The following bug fixes/enhancements were made to the game today:

o The bug with bash/trip saying it missed when it really hit has been fixed.  
   This may mean that mobs you used to bash are not bashable by you anymore, 
   particularly if those mobs have protection from good/evil.
o The bug with war gong and other staves casting too many spells has been 
  fixed.
o If you die while linkdead you will now loose all of your spells, like 
  normal.
o Buffed up and decreased variance of hitpoints for all classes.  Now you 
  will have less chance of "rolling bad" and ending up with drastically 
  lower hitpoints than others of your class.
o All remort classes now have better hitpoints than their non-remort 
  counterparts.
o Ninjas, Rangers, Psionics and Mystics received notable hitpoint buffs.
o The spell smokescreen now works as intended.

Please let me know if you experience problems with any of the above 
enhancements.

A Ranger-loving update today:  AMBUSH has been enhanced, along with
SHOOT.  

You can now quit your clan even if you are a clan leader.  Clans
with zero members will be disbanded automatically.

The castle guard's union has renegotiated their contract and as
a result you aren't able to ORDER them around anymore.  They'll
still do their best to protect your castle, though.

Various other minor bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------08.02.2002--

Improved the use of parry for you low-dexerity folks.  The help file
has been updated as well.

Castle owners can check out the new HOUSE command, which supports
transfering your castle to another player.  Also, all castles now
have a new friend that you can buy keys from, should the need arise.

A few more tweaks to the OUTLAW system went in today.  Thanks
for the (mostly) positive feedback.  

  o  OUTLAWs are still not safe in the temple,
     however they can now defend themselves if attacked.
  o  OUTLAWs can still be summoned through summon protection,
     however they now have partial resistance.
 
  o  Summon has been reworked.  The changes:
     - You must be summonable to summon another player.
     - There is a brief pause while toggling summon vs. !summon
     - You can no longer summon to !exit rooms or dumps

  o  You can now RETRIEVE corpses which have been beheaded

----------------------------------------------------------------02.08.2002--

In light of the new changes to the OUTLAW system, the Wizards
have declared a general amnesty to all existing OUTLAWs, provided
they return all recently stolen equipment to let everyone get a 
fresh start.  If you want a pardon, see a Wizard.  Please don't
ask a Chosen for a pardon this time, as they can't help you.

----------------------------------------------------------------02.08.2002--

The OUTLAW system has received a minor facelift.  Some of the changes:

  o  OUTLAWs are no longer safe in the temple
  o  knockout spells and skills (sleep, sleeper, subdue)
     only work when you are in the same level range as your
     intended victim (+/- 3 levels)
  o  OUTLAWs may be summoned through summon protection

  o  Although it is unrealistic, it is only possible to be
     robbed of equipment once every few game hours.  
     This prevents "full loot" stealing.
  o  steal only works when you are in the same level range as your
     intended victim (+/- 3 levels)

Help on PK and PSTEAL has been updated, remember that these help
files are part of the POLICY.  The major change to the help files
is that RP justification for player vs. player activities has been
dropped.

New clan castles were added to the game today! This of course invalidated
all of your old clan castle data, so if you are a clan leader, contact a
Wizard to get your castle set up.
