The policies set forth in this document are designed to maintain what
the staff of Dark Pawns considers to be a balanced, engaging fantasy
world. The policy also exists to ensure that everyone's experience on Dark
Pawns is an enjoyable one. We are always open to suggestions and
constructive critism of the policy by the players. These policies can not
and do not encompass all of the rules of the game but instead provide a
framework outlining acceptable behavoir of the players and staff. If
neccessary, punishments for policy infractions will be swift and severe. 


&cPlayer Characters:&n

You are limited to three multi-characters. This includes ALL
characters, whether in the game or in the player file.  You may
only have three (non-deleted) player characters TOTAL.  This group
model is central to the design of Dark Pawns, and promotes player
interaction, interdependancy, and teamwork.

Do not share your characters or the passwords to your characters
with anyone else for ANY reason. The staff will not reimburse you
if something bad happens to your characters as a result of sharing.
This is for your own benefit, as we would hate to see you loose a character
or characters that you have worked hard on due to stupidity on someone elses
part.

The buying and selling of player characters, whether for in game
or out of game benefit, is prohibited. 

Read HELP PK and HELP PSTEAL for all the details on Player
vesus Player activities on Dark Pawns. These documents should
be considered extensions of the POLICY.

&cEquipment:&n

If, for any reason, you posess an item whose stats have changed, you
must get an updated version of the item from a God. When items are
updated, there will be a list posted within the game.  This rule is
neccessary insofar as we have taken into careful consideration how equipment
influences play dynamics within the game.  


&cConduct:&n

Dark Pawns has been designed for a mature audience, and the players are
expected to act like adults (whether they are or not).  Immaturity will not
be tolerated by the staff or (we would expect) by your fellow players.
As in life, the golden rule reigns supreme for your conduct on Dark Pawns:
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Harassment of the staff and/or other players will not be tolerated.  We are
all here to have fun, but if your idea of fun is to verbally assult,
belittle, or ridicule other players you will be removed from the game.

Although it falls under harassment and immaturity, spam bears special 
mention.  Intentionally spamming rooms, tells, gossip, etc in an attempt to
harass other players is an insult to the players and to the entire mud.  If
you do this, you will be removed from the game.


&cGame play:&n

Do NOT exploit bugs.  This includes bugs in gameplay (unbalanced skills and
spells, unbalanced mobs).  Report all bugs with the BUG command and a mud
mail to the staff.

Do not advertise other muds on Dark Pawns.  Do not advertise Dark Pawns on
other muds, except where you are explictly allowed to do so. If you wish to
advertise your (or our) mud, please use a web page or newsgroup forum.

Do not play the game in a manner that is hostile to other players.  This
includes but is not limited to, activities such as camping (monopolizing a
game zone), kill stealing, using your skills to cripple/disable other
players outside the bounds of PK, and the like.


&cRole playing:&n

Although Role playing in its strictest sense is not a requirement on Dark
Pawns, you are still playing a fantasy character in a fantasy world, and are
required to act accordingly.

Character names MUST be fantasy oriented.  If you create a character with an
inappropriate name, you run the risk of that character being deleted without
reimbursement. Since the players have the capability to contribute so much
to the fantasy atmosphere, having players with names like "Johnny" or
"Android" spoils the atmosphere for the other players.

Your title must be fantasy oriented and it is strongly suggested that your
title reflect the persona (role-playing attributes) of your character.  Game
specific topics are allowed in titles, such as clan names.
Out of game and/or inappropriate titles will result in your character 
loosing the privilege of the title command.

It is strongly suggested that all new characters think up a fitting 
description for their character.  
You can add a description via the menu at the entrance and exit of the 
game.  All characters above level 10 are required to have an appropriate
description for their characters.  At minimum it must be one paragraph
(three sentences) long and fantasy oriented.  Out of game and/or
inappropriate descriptions will be dealt with accordingly.


&cStaff:&n

The staff of Dark Pawns includes the immortals as well as mortals who have
been chosen to work as staff assisting the imms.  Obey their wishes, do not
lie to them, and do not harass them because of their position.  Do not put
down the MUD or the staff on public channels. If you have a problem with any
staff member, send a mudmail to the Implementor.



If you absolutely MUST e-mail someone about mud related topics:
        rparet@talon.wolfpaw.net
Mudmail will be replied to much more promptly.
