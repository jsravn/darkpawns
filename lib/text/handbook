Imms are allowed to have mortals, but are not allowed to use their godly
	powers to help them. If you have questions about this, ask an Imp.

About mortals* (this includes your own):
	Don't heal them. (Unless they're a level 1 down on their luck, and
		then only once.)
	Don't tell them their stats.
	Don't use godly powers to help/inform them in any way.
	Don't use godly powers to hinder them in any way.**
	Don't restring items for them, except as a quest reward.
	If you are under level 32, you are NOT permitted to do reimbursements.
		This means do not load equipment for ANY mortal for ANY reason.
	Any reimbursements done by level 32+ must be posted on the board in
		room 1204, stating who, what and why.

About quests*:
	Don't give out quest items that are worth more than you can load.
	If you restring an item, make sure it is named correctly. i.e: if an
		item is called "Bob's Farslayer" it's name should 
		have "farslayer" in it.
	Don't give out quest items for killing a mob that is easier than the
		mob the item normally loads on. 
	Don't restring items to have names that are outside of the swords n'
		sorcery theme. (i.e no guns, etc.)

 * Breaking these rules is ground for demotion.
** When is it acceptable to hinder mortals? When they break the rules mentioned
in POLICY. Use as little force as neccessary.

About advertising:
	Please don't advertise over public channels on other muds, or post
our address on boards there (unless they specifically say you can, like
PKMud). We don't allow it here, so we shouldn't do it elsewhere. 
	Advertisements to newsgroups will be posted by Orodreth; if you know of
a group he's not posting to, let him know.
	If you advertise somewhere, use the address: pawns.guru.org 4000
This address will follow us wherever we go.

Hate to do it, but just in case:
 
 All areas created become the joint property of the creator and Serapis.
This means if you decide to leave the mud for some unknown reason, you
can take your area elsewhere (Hey, you made it!) but since you made it
for here, we're gonna keep it (since we went to lots of pains to integrate
it) too. We also have the right to change it as we see fit; of course we'll
give you at LEAST an imm position and/or credit for it as the conditions
warrant. Of course, violation of the above rules means your given position
can be taken away.
If you want a copy of your finished area, let an Imp know and we'll mail it to
you.(email, in ASCII format)
