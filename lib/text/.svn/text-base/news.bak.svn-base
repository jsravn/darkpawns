As you've doubtless discovered already, some areas have been updated.
There are also a few new areas in the game, with more on the way. Where
are these new areas located? Well, we'd like to tell you, but we forgot.
If you find 'em, let us know.

Dark Pawns 2.2.4 is released!  This is an interim (read: non-major) release
but is sure to have enough goodies to keep you and your friends occupied
long enough to spoil your promising school career.  We promise.

Hey! Where did the old NEWS go?  Well, its been rotated off.  Sometimes
you just need to start fresh.  Fun fact:  Did you know that Dark Pawns 2.2
was released over TWO YEARS AGO?  Neither did I, until I looked at the old
NEWS file.  Congradulations and thanks to everyone that has been with us
since then and before.
