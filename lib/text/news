Lots of updates today:
         
o Various weapons have been made two handed. They have higher APRs but
  prevent the use of shields and held items.
o New forging quests have been added.
o New veteran status granted based on a player's experience.
o Regeneration rates have been overhauled. They no longer get worse with
  old age.
o Load rates have been tweaked. Some items that were previously
  near impossible to get are now loadable.
o Plenty of other changes to be discovered.
