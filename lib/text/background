  The gods have always been, and always will be. And having free will, given 
to them by Chaos, they created on their own, and brought forth likenesses, 
who strive to become as gods, and join them in their omnipotence.
  Like a great game of chess, the world has become a board filled with bishops
and kings, stately queens, white knights and dark pawns striving to rise 
through the ranks into godhood.
  The races of the world have become holed up in their cities and towns, hiding
behind mortar walls and fending off the forces of nature (and other races) with
cold steel and blood spilt by the persuasion of gold. Outside those thick walls
that enable "civilised" persons to sleep so well lies an untamed land, some
parts still ruled by the power of fangs, claws, and magick. The other parts
of the savage land are not ruled at all; twisted and warped by forgotten arts
into a vision that would make any sane man's nightmare seem like a pleasant
summer daydream.
  Beware the unseen, adventurer. The power is there, cloaked in a forgotten
tomb or a dragon's hoard, but it is there. But beware.
