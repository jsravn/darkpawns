! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The

#
ALIAS ALIASES

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

#
ANSI COLOR

Usage: color [off | sparse | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.
'color on' defaults to 'complete'.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

See also: COLORSPRAY, "COLOR SPRAY"
#

person you're assisting is fighting.

small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"

HOUSE

Usage: house guest <player name>

primary owner of a house (not guests) may change the guest list using the
HOUSE command.

The HOUSE command can also transfer ownership of the house from one player
to another.  If you do this and wish to retain access to the house, make
sure the transfering character is on the guest list before you transfer!

Typing 'house guest' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently 
on your house's guest list.  Typing 'house guest' with the name of a player 
will add that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, 
or will remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on 
the list.

The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

Guests of your house will be able to enter your house until you remove them

Kuji-Kiri ("nine ways cutting") is a form of mystical meditation involving
finger interlacing. The ninja is taught nine different ways to interlace
his fingers, each with its own symbolic significance. By meditating on this

game hours) nature.

Kyo   - "direction of energy"              - performance in battle increases
Toh   - "force and vulnerability"          - more power, less defense
Sha   - "healing"                          - hit points increase
Kai   - "the strength within"              - less power, more defense
Zhen  - "endurance"                        - vitality increases
Retsu - "mastery of time and space"        - ninja teleports 
Zai   - "the mask of illusion"             - ninja becomes invisible

#
MULTI MULTIPLAY MULTI-PLAY

Dark Pawns has been designed to be a challenging mud.  Because of this, 
Playing only one char who doesn't group with other players will prove to
be tough. At first, a solo player should be able to do fine by themselves.
However, it will take some time to level and earn decent equipment. Once 
you get into the mid levels though, going solo might prove to be extremely
difficult. A level 1 player fighting a level 1 mob is about even.  A level
15 player fighting a level 15 mob doesn't probably stand a chance.

Because some players prefer to adventure alone, we have instituted a policy
Of multi-playing in order to offset this somewhat. Each player may have a 
Total of 3 characters at any given time. More than three players is not 
tolerated and will be severely punished when caught (I think this policy is 
More than generous, why push it?) Please note, linkdead characters that are 
still in game count towards your three multis. Log 'em out if you aren't 
using them.

Finally, if you don't know about mud-clients:
you should look into them. In a nutshell, mud-clients are front-end 
programs that allow you to manage aspects of mudding much easier, including
multi characters. Ask a high level player about them or search them out on 
the web. Three popular ones are Tintin, Tinyfugue(both for UNIX shell accounts) 
and Zmud (Windows based). Please do not bother the Imms and Gods about mud
clients!

#
NEWBIE
 
Newbie is a term used to describe people who are new to MUDding, and sometimes
just one particular MUD. As a newbie you start out with a few choice pieces
of equipment and enough food to last until you gather enough money to buy
more. The INFO and POLICY commands will tell you the rules and basics of
Dark Pawns, and the NEWS file will keep you updated on various added features.
Also, check out help FAQ, which has the answers to some of frequently asked
newbie questions.

You will start out in the Temple of your home town.  The first thing you should
do is find your GUILD and PRACTICE your starting skills.  After that, investigate
the training areas available in your city.  The Guard Barracks in Kir Drax'in is
one of the best places to start.  Once there you will be able to kill things for
EXPERIENCE so you can gain levels and become more powerful.

Renting here is free, but only in certain areas, the main one being the Temple
and Altar in the city of Kir Drax'in. The HELP MAP file will show you a map of
Kir Drax'in, and the locations of all the stores, guilds and sub-areas within.

Once you get on your way, you'll probably want to check out information on
MULTIplaying, which the mud is designed for.

#
TITLE

Usage: title <new title>

Sets the title people see on the WHO list and when you're in the room with
them.  You can't use parentheses (the "(" and ")" characters) because those
are reserved for flags.

Do not abuse this command; if you do, it will be taken from you.

#
TOGGLE

Usage: toggle

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the MUD.
This command CAN NOT be used to change these values (see related commands.)
All of these toggles remain the same until you change them; i.e. they are
saved when you quit or rent.

#
TRACK

Usage: track <victim>

Used for finding the first step on the shortest route to another person. A 
Failed attempt results in the wrong direction.  Some people are more 
difficult to track than others. Tracking also doesn't work very well when
it is raining outside, or if there is a body of water separating you from
your target.

Example:

  > track warg
  You sense a trail south from here!

#
TRANSFORM

Usage: transform

This command allows lycanthropes and vampires to change form from common
man into nightbreed. Beast-shape can only be assumed during the night
hours, and only be shed during the day -- once you transform, there's no 
going back until the next dusk/dawn.

#
TRIP

Usage: trip <victim>

Causes the victim to fall, leaving them open for more damage.

See also: COMBAT
#
TURN

With this power, a cleric or avatar can cause undead forces in the same
room to flee from his presence.  This power varies with level, and low
level clerics may not be able to turn away certain powerful (ie: demonic)
undead forces.  On the upside, very powerful clerics and avatars are able
to completely destroy lesser undead.

Please note that this is a SKILL, not a SPELL, although it does consume
MANA.  The amount of mana consumed is proportional to the clerics level.

#
UNGROUP

Usage: ungroup [group member]

UNGROUP can be used by group leaders to disband the entire group, or
to kick a specific group member out of the group (and stop him/her from
following the leader).

Examples:

  > ungroup
  > ungroup homer

#
USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: use <staff>
       use <wand> <Target>

Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staffs are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

#
VALUE

Usage: value <item>

Before selling an item to a shop, you can ask the shopkeeper how much
he or she is willing to pay for it.

#
WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

Commands for changing your position.  If you feel weary, it's probably 
a good idea to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even take a nap.

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your health 
More quickly.  You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while 
asleep. You can awaken yourself (and others) with the WAKE command.

Also, certain rooms such as holy rooms and places of ancient power allow
you to heal and regenerate faster.

#
WEAR

Usage: wear <item> [location]

Use this if you want to wear some clothes, armor or the like.

Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing 
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment 
on.

Examples:

  > wear boots
  > wear all.bronze
  > wear all
  > wear ring finger

 If you have more than one pair in your inventory
  > wear 2.boots
