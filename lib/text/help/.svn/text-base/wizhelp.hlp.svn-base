ACTION A-DESC

The A-desc (action desc) of objs is used for held wands, held staves, scrolls
and potions! Please don't confuse it with Extra description, which is what you 
see when you LOOK <object>. 
The A-desc is shown when the item is used/quaffed/recited. For example, a 
potion of lycanthropy might have:
$n quaffs $p and hair sprouts from $s every pore!

"ACT FLAGS"

Each control character is preceded by a '$'.

$n - Write name, short description, or "someone", for ch, depending on whether 
	ch is a PC, a NPC, or an invisible PC/NPC.
$N - Like $n, except insert the text for victim
$m - "him", "her", or "it", depending on the gender of ch.
$M - Like $m, for vict.
$s - "his", "her", or "it", depending on the gender of ch.
$S - Like $s, for vict.
$e - "he", "she", "it", depending on the gender of ch.
$E - Like $e, for vict.
$o - Name or "something" for obj, depending on visibility.
$O - Like $o, for vict_obj. i.e. A wand of invis pointed at a sword; sword is $O
$p - Short description or "something" for obj.
$P - Like $p for vict_obj.
$a - "an" or "a", depending on the first character of obj's name.
$A - Like $a, for vict_obj.
$T - Prints the string pointed to by vict_obj.
$F - Processes the string pointed to by vict_obj with fname() prior to printing.
$$ - Print the character '$'.


Example:
Drakos is is holding a wand of invis and uses it on Xira.
$n points $p at $N, and $E vanishes!
would print:
Drakos points a wand of invis at Xira, and she vanishes!

ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

BUILDING BUILD

Some not-so-obvious things about OLC:

REDIT: Room flags: REGEN_ROOM .. PCs (and mobs) rege mana/HPs faster in this
			room. 
		   BFR  .. Bad for recall, recall doesn't work here.
                   NEUTRAL .. can't die here. PCs get sent back to the temple
	                  instead. As such, entry to these rooms (or the rooms
                          themselves), should be !MOB
		   PEACEFUL .. violence and violent magic isn't allowed here.
		   ATRIUM, *, and HCRSH ..  do not use
		   PRIVATE .. Only two people allowed here. If more try to 
			enter, they get the following message:
			" A private conversation is going on in that room"
		   TUNNEL ..  Only one person allowed here. If more try to 
			enter, they get the following message:
		        "There's no room for you there!"
 		   BFS, *, ATRIUM, HCRSH, HOUSE, and **: do not use
	See Also: HELP FLOW
			
As of 2.2, Sector types only affect movement rate.

The sectors: Earth, Air, Water, Fire are for use in the elemental planes.

OEDIT:  When making a liquid container, the first alias-name should be the
name of the liquid initially in the container (unless it's empty, of course).
The second name should be the item.. only 2 names should be used.
Example: water skin   OR     beer bottle 
Cost, vs. cost-per-day: The cost is the value of the item. This should not 
exceed 10000. Cost-per-day is the number used to calculate wether or not
the item will load. In most cases, assign cost-per-day = cost. If cost per
day is > 10000, the difference is the % chance the item will have to load.
Example: 
  item: a loaf o bread    cost:5 cost-per-day:10100 (loads 100% of the time)
  item: a dagger of blood cost:8500 cost-per-day:8500 (approx 10% of the time)
  item: a helm of greed   cost:300  cost-per-day:10050 (loads 50% of the time)

To be able to backstab with an item, it must be type "pierce". Clerics can not
use slashing weapons, even if they don't have a !CLERIC flag on them.

HELP NAMED
HELP ACTION

MEDIT:  Setting the LEVEL (choice 6) puts defaults into the other blanks, so
set the mobs level first, then the other slots, else they will get over-
written.
When setting a mob with flag 21 (RNDLD-ZONE), use zedit to load him anywhere
in your zone. The RNDLD-ZONE flag will cause his location to actually be a
random room in the zone. It won't load in GODROOM, PRIVATE, !MOB, or DEATH 
rooms.
Noise is the message sent to rooms surrounding the mob every once in a
	while... An example for a dragon might be:
	"You hear the sound of great wings rustling."
	or perhaps:
	"A cloud of noxious gas wafts into the room."
See HELP NOISE

  AWARE (flag 5) mobs can't be backstabbed. AGGR24 (flag 20) makes the mob 
aggressive to PCs level 24 and above. AGGR24 mobs speak before attacking, and 
sometimes gossip when they have killed. A mob flagged AGGR24 and AGGR(flag 6) 
will attack other mobs that are 3+ levels below him, but only when fully 
healed.  HUNTER(flag 19) mobs will hunt through !mob rooms, and a hunting mob 
ignores their own SENTINEL(flag 2) assignment.
  
  If you add "carve_meat", "carve_rabbit", "carve_fish", or "carve_bird" to a
mob's namelist, they will become carveable.

SEDIT: Sell rate should be lower than buy rate. Using the Rooms menu(choice R)
then adding a new sell room (choice A)  with the vnum of 1 will make a mob 
sell anywhere.. good for making wandering shopkeepers.

ZEDIT: If you use an item/mob created in another zone, post it on the board so
Serapis or Oddity can up the max_exist for the entire world. 
About max-exist: since %load controls objects loading, set the max_exist for
eq loading on a mob to 999, unless it an extremely powerful item or an artifact.
Set the max_exist for eq loading directly into a room (like ATMs) to 1.

CAUTION: Items given to shopkeeper's are affected by %load. If you want a 
shopkeeper to ALWAYS have a certain item (like, for example, the baker to have 
bread), make the item's cost-per-day 10100.

CHECKLOAD

Usage: checkload < obj | mob > <virtual number>

Used to check where a particular mobile or object loads given its virtual

WIZAT

Usage: at <room VNUM | item | mob | player name> <command> <arguments>

AT can be used to perform an action in a location other than where you are
standing.  The first argument can be a virtual room number or the name of a
character or object.  The remainder of the line is passed to the command
interpreter.

Examples:

  > at 3001 look
  > at fido kill fido
  > at 3.corpse get all corpse
  > at catje wave catje

#
BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

#
CHOSEN

The CHOSEN flag means a mortal is chosen of the gods.

The CHOSEN character is basically a playtester for the game, and can
both see and use WIZNET. 

To speak to true imms only, use WIZNET #31 <message>.

Mortals do not see the CHOSEN flag (even Chosen mortals) on anyone but
themselves.

DC

Usage: dc <descriptor number>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket.  If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

ECHO GECHO QECHO SEND

Usage: echo <message>
       gecho <message>
       send <victim> <message>
       qecho <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.
GECHO displays the string to everyone in the game.
QECHO displays the string to everyone with the QUEST flag.
SEND displays the string to a particular person.

Examples:

  > echo Hi, everyone in the room.

#
FLOW ROOM_FLOW ROOM_FLOW_NORTH FLOWING

These rooms push the inhabitants in the direction specified. The message
"<name> drifts <direction>." is sent to the room. 

Sector-based drift messages can be created if needed. (i.e. For sector wind, 
perhaps "<name> is blown <dir>.")

Room inhabitants have a 50% chance of getting pushed every 10 and 15 seconds.

wizonly
#
FORCE

Usage: force <victim | all> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Example:

  > force fido drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
wizonly
#
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

#
GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

  You create the receptionist.

  > load mob warg
  You create the hybrid warg.

  > load obj ring

#
NOISE

      The noise option for mobs adds an interesting element to the mud.
The noise of the mob is heard through all the exits of his room.
      Now if you create a room that can only be exited and place a noisey
mob within.  The mob will project his noise through the exits into the
other rooms.  A player in these rooms will hear the noises, but will
not know their origins.  Application: Haunted House -moaning spirits-
                                    : Monster cave -drums in the deep-
      But the noise option doesn't need to be limited to noises.  Using
the noise option the mud simply states your noise statement as you have
written in. 
         O)Noise : You here the chirping of crickets.
         > You hear the chirping of crickets.
With this idea in mind you can create non-noise 'noises'.  Using the 
noise option and the 'hidden' mob, you can create enviromental effects.
Ex. 'You feel a cool breeze', 'You stumble on the slick floor.'  
These effects will continue to occur at the same interval as regular 
noises, but because the mob is unreachable and unkillable (!SUMM,SENTINEL),
The noise will never end.  Application: Sea shore -breeze-
                                      : Garbage heap -trip-
                                      : Wet cavern -slip-

PURGE

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

#
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

Field                 Level Required    Who     Value
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    { "brief",          LVL_GOD,        PC,     BINARY },

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Players currently cannot be strung.
