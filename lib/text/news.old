As you've doubtless discovered already, some areas have been updated.
There are also a few new areas in the game, with more on the way. Where
are these new areas located? Well, we'd like to tell you, but we forgot.
If you find 'em, let us know.

----------------------------------------------------------------02.27.2000--

Please be sure and read the updated POLICY, and also help on PK and PSTEAL.
These are the changes some of you have been waiting a LONG time for.  Thanks
for being patient.  The new POLICY takes effect immediately.

----------------------------------------------------------------02.27.2000--

Dark Pawns 2.2.4 is released!  This is an interim (read: non-major) release
but is sure to have enough goodies to keep you and your friends occupied
long enough to spoil your promising school career.  We promise.

Hey! Where did the old NEWS go?  Well, its been rotated off.  Sometimes
you just need to start fresh.  Fun fact:  Did you know that Dark Pawns 2.2
was released over TWO YEARS AGO?  Neither did I, until I looked at the old
NEWS file.  Congratulations and thanks to everyone that has been with us
since then and before.

New On Dark Pawns:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  All clan castles have become corrupted, and we had to trash the database.
   If you can't get in to your castle and/or all your gear is missing, that's 
   why.
   We are working on a solution, but it is a fairly major problem, so please 
   be patient.

*  VERY IMPORTANT! Please read the updated Dark Pawns POLICY. The new 
   policy changes take effect on May 7th, 1999 so please plan accordingly!

*  Rangers have some new skills, see the updated help on RANGER.

*  Mirror image has been added for PSIONICS and MYSTICS.

*  A whole slew of clan options have been added, see help CLAN for
   a listing of most of the new features. Players may quit their clans
   without leader consent. Clan enroll with no arguments shows a list of
   applied players. Clan descriptions work (via clan plan). Clan leaders
   can make their clans private, and much more!

*  WATERBREATHE spell fixed, see updated help on MAGE and MAGUS.

*  You should be able to abbreviate lots of things now, such as the names
   of mobiles and players.

*  The world has been updated a little bit, remember if any items you
   have have been changed, you must turn them in to a god for a new
   one.  

*  Added in METEOR SWARM, it was accidentaly left out of the original
   release.

*  Changed invulnerability spell to GLOBE OF INVULNERABILITY, as it
   was originally intended.

*  See updated help on TRACK and COMPARE.

*  AMBUSH now works how it was originally supposed to.

*  Due to the number of assassins who felt that backstab had be unfairly
   impaired, backstab now works a little differently now.  Don't expect
   any great miracles with it though.

*  Problems with FLEEing during combat have been fixed. You are free
   to run away screaming now.

*  Ok, all the minor bugs have been ironed out.  All the classes now have
   skill lists in their appropriate help files now.

*  Dark Pawns 2.2 RELEASED 12-19-1998.  See help on CHANGES for partial info
   and see the help files if certain things work differently for you now.
