a small caravan.  His clothes are new, obviously stolen, and the glass
dagger at his side has obviously never been used.

Spaedrich dragon blue~
Spaedrich, the blue dragon~
A massive blue dragon rests quietly here, pointedly ignoring you.
~
The blue dragon stretches her massive wings as she absorbs the warmth
from the sands beneath her.  The suns have made her scales a glistening
sapphire colour that sparkles against the light and gives her an almost
holy appearance.  Her wingspan is easily 100 feet wide, which almost
matches her incredible length.
