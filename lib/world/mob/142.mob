zephyr~
Zephyr~
Zephyr is standing here, with flowers blooming at his bare feet.
~
Dressed in ragged brown robes, with his thin limbs poking out from the sleeves,
this man seems a very humorous sight. But as he looks at you, you seem to peer
into his soul and see a very strong man, who has lived throughout a long and
hard life without many friends. His eyes glimmer with a vast intelligence as he
watches you.

bhang~
Bhang~
Amidst all the ambient green smoke that permeates this place, Bhang stands before you.
~
This short, stocky man radiates a distinct aura of power. His face is etched
with lines and scars mark a lot of his skin that is not under his clothing. When
he notices you looking at him, he gives you a wink, smiles, and gets ready to
fight.

Skarash~
Skarash is standing here, looking intimidating.
~
He is an ogre, and a large one with that, although he seems all muscle, you get
the feeling that he has a very cunning mind. All his clothing is black or red,
maybe he's part of some clan?

Darklord~
Darklord is standing here, off adventuring in his own imagination.
~
A tall and powerfully built man, Darklord looks like he's fought many battles,
his tunic is hanging open and you see a massive palm-print imbedded into his
chest. When he sees you watching him, he snaps out of his daydream and begins
walking towards you.

of speed about him.

Saint~
Saint is standing here, looking around in awe.
~
He looks lost and somehow...new. You sense he is a student of the priestly arts
but you do not know whom he worships. When he notices you and your weapon, his
eyes grow large in fear.

This is the first half-orc you've ever seen, and it's not a pretty sight, he
isn't as fearsome-looking as an orc, he looks more pathetic than powerful.

Eyspethar~
Eyspethar stands here, trying to think of a confusing idea.
~
He isn't like most ogres you've seen, he has tusks that grow from the bottom of
his mouth up, making it look like his jawbone is upside down. Although he's an
ogre, he seems to be a very learned one, and is dressed in fancy-looking
clothes.

tefnut~
Tefnut~
Tefnut is here, being a total bitch.
~
Although you can tell she used to be pretty, now she is barely even homely and
she makes her money selling herself. She was once the great MaYuan's concubine
but, as all things do, she got old and stopped trying to keep herself looking
good. Once that happened, MaYuan quickly discarded her like a used tissue.

thin and moves with the grace of a jungle cat, his muscles rippling underneath
his clothes as he walks towards you.

Shrike is standing here, trying to act cool.

A powerful swordsman, though not as powerful as Infidel or Dozois, he fights
like a bat out of hell. His clothes are all either gold or blue, perhaps this
means something? Nope.

help.
