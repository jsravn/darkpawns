a deva~
A deva stands guard here.
~
  A winged human with golden skin and glowing golden eyes.  Your unsure if the
deva is a devine creature or a magical construct, considering it's unsual
appearance.  Then again, almost nothing in Elysium is exactly what one would
expect.  Regardless, the deva looks like it means business.

illusion?

him to hover in the air.

enough to easily kill a horse and fly away with it.
