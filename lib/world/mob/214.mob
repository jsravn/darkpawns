ahuizotl dark shadow~
the ahuizotl~
A dark shadow passes beneath the surface.
~
You can't quite get a good look at it, but it has very mammalian features
and appears to have extremely sharp teeth. Should it get close enough to you,
you'll find out exactly how sharp...

a great white shark~
A large fin sticks out of the water with a large shadow underneath.
~
This great beast of the ocean is around twenty feet in length with a
mouthful of mean looking dagger-like teeth.  It's belly is the color
of snow and it seems to be looking at you with a fierce hunger in its
eyes.

Leviathan sea dragon~
the Leviathan~
A massive serpentine creature swims here, leaving destruction in its wake.
~
The Leviathan's skin is like a double coat of chainmail, with overlapping
scales as large as shields on its back, and as sharp and hard as jagged steel
on its under-parts. It breathes smoke from its nostrils and flames from its
mouth which is rimmed with teeth. Its fins radiate a brilliant light and its
eyes are like the glimmerings of dawn.
