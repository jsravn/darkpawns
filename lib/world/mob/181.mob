the borogrove~
A borogrove is sitting on a thorny branch here looking mimsy.
~
A borogrove is a thin and shabby looking bird with feathers sticking out
all around.  Borogroves look something like live mops; in general they
look mimsy -- flimsy and miserable.  The do not even sing well, in
fact their song has been found to ivoke violent reactions in most people.

tove~
the tove~
A slithy tove is sitting here looking confused.
~
Toves are small but fierce burrowing mammals; they are something like
badgers, something like lizards, and something like corkscrews.  They are,
indeed, strange creatures.  The best word to describe them is slithy which
means lithe and slimy.
It is common knowledge that the favorite food of a tove is tumtum fruit.

helper~
the trimmer's helper~
A trimmer's helper is here, picking up clippings and tending the hedges.
~
The helper is dressed in thick, protective clothes so that the thorns do
not poke her.  She is walking around picking up hedge clippings but she
seems to be very nervious; she checks over her shoulder every now so
often.

jabberwock jabberwocky~
the Jabberwock~
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, is whiffling through the air here.
~
The Jabberwock is a fearful bandersnatch; his bright eyes constantly glance
this way and that searching for prey to devour.  His large jaw is lined
with fearfully sharp teeth and long claws grow from his arms.  Two big,
leathery wings sprout from his back and his long, thrashing tail looks
dragon-like.  I hope he doesn't see you or you will become dinner!
