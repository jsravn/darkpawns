the Gatekeeper~
A tall, lanky demon stands here, guarding the gate.
~
Although his form is clumsy-looking, you get the feeling that if he doesn't
want you through the gate, you won't get through the gate until he changes his
mind. His angular, scaled face turns towards you as he notices you watching
him and he smiles, showing off a set of sharp, yellowed teeth.

Although he is a demon, he radiates the aura of a well-mannered butler. He seems
nice and politely asks you if you need anything, but as you get a good look at
his horned, red face, you get the feeling he could pop your head like a pimple,
if the order was given.

One of the rare and extremely powerful alhoon, or illithilich, Alhazred was
exiled by his own kind, and Gil-Glash took him into the Grey Keep in exchange
for occasional services, which Alhazred figured was a good trade. He is about
six feet tall and has dry, wrinkled mauve-colored skin. His head resembles an
octopus, with white, pupil-less eyes, and four tentacles around his mouth,
which itself is a round, many-toothed orifice like that of a lamprey. He has
three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

It was once a very knowledgable sage who predicted the downfall of one of
Gil-Glash's greatest enemies, who knowing opportunity's unique knock, called
the sage to the Grey Keep and made him an advisor. When the sage eventually
died of old age, Gil-Glash had a huge ceremony in which he burned several of

life.

succeeded if it didn't trip one of Nimos' magickal alarms. When Nimos came

to capture the yuk-shaar by the end of the fight, but he managed to do it and

legs, all which end in sharp claws. Its dark purple skin looks extremely
thick and tough. Its large, red eyes glow with an evil light. The beast's
teeth are very long, more than half a foot in length, and look sharp enough
to cut through solid stone with ease. Two pairs of its teeth are nearly twice
as long as the rest, one is set in the upper jaw, the other in the lower jaw.
It has two large, tusk-like horns on its head. The nightmare beast was set
against the Grey Keep by one of Gil-Glash's more powerful enemies, but Lady
Amber took it upon herself to defend the Keep against the horrid creature.
They fought for hours and hours, neither seeming to tire, but in the end Lady
Amber prevailed and she hath incapacitated the beast, and had Nimos teleport

rounded ears. A druidic magickal spell gone awry created the rampager, and the
minute Gil-Glash heard of it's destructive capabilities, he sent Hisczdrezzez
to obtain it. The yuan-ti was overjoyed at finally having something to do other
than roam around the Grey Keep, and took his job very seriously. It took a 
year and a few months of tracking and several failed attempts at capture, but
Hisczdrezzez finally brought it back to his leige.

gulguthydra~
a gulguthydra~
A disgusting, garbage-covered gulguthydra crawls around here.
~
The mix between an otyugh and a hydra, this truly is a disgusting creature. Six
misshapen hydra heads perch in a circle atop the hulking body of the hybrid,
which also possesses an otyughs two rigid tentacles. Its skin looks hard,
almost rocklike, and its dusky brown coloration aids it in hiding within its
chosen domain. Nobody knows what brought it there, but the gulguthydra was
found in the sewers beneath the Grey Keep, it took a large group of Grey
Slayers to bring it back up, and when Gil-Glash saw it, he didn't want it to
be destroyed so he ordered that they herd it into a cell in the second dungeon.

girl concubine~
one of Gil-Glash's concubines~
One of Gil-Glash's teenage concubines is here.
~
She can't be much over fifteen, but her body seems more mature than you'd think
for someone her age. Her ample breasts and pouting lips make her look like some
sort of harlot, which she is, basically.

young boy~
a young boy~
A young boy is here, waiting for Gil-Glash.
~
Gil-Glash sometimes gets tired of women, so he resorts to rutting with young
boys. The boy is not even ten, and pale skin makes him look sickly.
