An enormous, carnivorous mountain gorilla stands here, watching you.

around you is not enough to suppress the stench of rotting meat that comes
from its unkempt, ungroomed body.

past meals, betraying her nearly perfect snowy camoflauge.

opted to stay in the Valley of the Sulfur Fur and not migrate to the warmer
climates in lower elevations.  His black mustache and beard seems to join
neatly with the cut of his fur vest and skins while his elkskin leggings
fit precisely to the tip of his boots.
