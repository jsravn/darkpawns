a homeless bum~
A homeless bum dreams of a new pair of underwear.

This poor fellow has made a cardboard box his residence. He seems to live off
selling water from pickle jars in a nearby cart. With one look at them,
however, you question whether or not they are sanitary. Unfortunately for the
bum, however, people seem to be stealing his water while he rests his
eyes. One word can describe this man, stinky like old cheese that smells really
bad.
