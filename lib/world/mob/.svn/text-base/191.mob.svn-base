Skullgrin~
Skullgrin~
Skullgrin, captain of the Ocean Fate looms before you.
~
Captain Skullgrin appears as a floating decomposing humanoid.  The tattered
clothing wrapped around his skeletal frame shows signs of freshly splattered
blood.  An eyepatch covers his left eye, and you are glad of that small
comfort considering the immense evil eminating from the dark eyeless 
socket where his right eye should be.  The evil surrounding the captain
chills you to the bone.  No wonder the permanent residents of the ship bow
to him...

Serpent~
a Ghastly Sea Serpent~
A Ghastly Sea Serpent lies in wait here...
~
Looming before you is a gargantuan rotting serpent.  Old dry flesh still
seems to stick to the bones of this behemoth monster in patches.  A dark
smoke eminates from it's mouth, and sends chills up and down your spine.
The glowing red eyes seems to transfix you as it prepares to make a meal
of you!

the Lookout~
A rotting Lookout stands watch here.
~
Hanging about before you is the ship's lookout.  This unnatural being's 
body has been ravaged by time and evil.  The rags barely concealing the
rotting corpse make you thankful there is a slight wind up here, 
otherwise the smell alone could probably be enough to do you in...

An undead seagull hovers here.

This flying apparition of a seagull looks like it missed one too many meals.
Half rotted flesh and dusty feathers do little to conceal the thin
skeletal frame of this former avian.

A Ghostly Cabinboy stumbles about here.

This specter floating about before you resembles an animated shadow.  The
creature is a humanoid child in shape, with no apparent discernible 
features other than the pale white eyes set off by the dark form itself.

a Hellhound~
A Hellhound stalks about here.
~
A half rotted canine stalks about you.  Flesh falls away from the beast
in chunks, revealing more and more of it's skeleton, and dried out 
intestines.  One side of the beast's face reveals a permanent hideous snarl.
As you listen in dismay to the low unearthly growl of the beast, you
notice its eyes watching your every move.

soul appears to be wearing what's left of some old imperial clothing,

failed...

~
The empty eyesockets give you a creepy feeling that this being wishes to
share it's eternal misery with you.  The strange grin of the skeleton's
skull gives you a scare, as the moaning of the background walls helps to
entice your feelings of fright.

A grotesquely bloated quivering cadaver is all that remains of a former
chef.  The undead chef approaches you as if to offer you something to eat.
The mere sight of this phantasm is enough to frighten you and at the same
time make you lose your appetite...

Another hapless victim of an ancient tragedy that is this vessel.  Even
as you look upon the specter before you, you notice that you are also 
pearing through it as well.  The transparent, dim white glow of this 
figure gives you an eerie fright.

rusted, hole-ridden armor.  Bone fragments and blood stains are sprinkled
about the floor in front of it.  The eyeless stare of this sentinel is
very unnerving.

Lingering before you is the apparition known as Dread, the first mate to
the captain.  This horrendous figure before you drips a spinetingling
mysterious glowing matter.  Dread's body is glowing in a rotting decay.
All semblages of flesh mix with what you guess is what's left of his garb,
and form an amorphous spotting all over the broken bones of the corpse
that is animated before you.
