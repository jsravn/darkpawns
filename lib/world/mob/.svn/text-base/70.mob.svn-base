gets weaker the more that is used, and the chance of never waking up

sizes, and sex.

Glancing back across the table you see Lady Sophie, as she likes to be called,
Master Artisan of the Arts & Crafts Guild. Unlike most of the rest, she 
ignores your presence and continues to read something. Is that a map of the
city on the table in front of her?

Finally looking to the end of the table sits an unknown figure, fully 
withdrawn into the shadows surrounding his chair. You can discern nothing of 
their identity. Judging by the size of the figure sitting, they must be well
over six feet tall. Thinking hard, you try to place them in this who's who of
power figures from Kir Draxin's upper eschelon. You hear someone clear their
throat.  Perhaps you'd best leave now.

Jasper Withrold~
Jasper Withrold, Scribe to His Holiness putters about here.
~
Small and anemic, Jasper is typical of most scribes. The term bookish comes
to mind when envisioning him. His pinched features and hawk nose make him
a rather distinctive individual. Combined with his outlandishly ornate
emerald colored robes, you doubt Jasper could hide if he wanted to.
