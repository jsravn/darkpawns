hunting dog dharzi~
a Dharzi hunting dog~
One of the Dharzi hunting dogs growls at your presense.
~
It first appears to be a dog, but this is no dog...it is half dog and half
bird with a lean, shaggy body and legs but also possessing birdlike talons in
place of paws and savagely curved beaks which snap where muzzles should be.
These strange creatures have been domesticated by the Dharzi orcs, the only
things the dogs won't attack. Unfortunately, you don't appear to be a Dharzi
orc.
