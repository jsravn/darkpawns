dragon ice kaerdein~
Kaerdein the Ice Dragon~
A dragon as white and clear as ice rises up before you.
~
   This dragon, known as Kaerdein is the ice dragon that has terrorized this
region in times past. He's not old, only heard of within the last 100 years,
and he has been hibernating for the last 30, so little is known about him. The
younger people in Bhyroga think of him as a myth now, but their elders know
he is out here somewhere, and dread his return.
