guardian demons tome book~
You come upon an interesting passage:

    One day, while traversing the forest, I came upon a guardian demon, which
I recognized from my studies. Forever curious, and knowing they usually aren't
dangerous, I walked up to it and started up a conversation. Apparently I was
wrong, guardian demons are able to let people get to what they're guarding
but only in exchange for either large amounts of money, powerful magickal items
and artifacts, or souls. This intrigued me, so I asked if it was able to leave
once it has been bribed and it began ranting and raving about how guardian
demons never leave their posts.

It seems to be made out of some magickal substance, but you have no idea what.
As you look more closely you notice the light in the room does not reflect off
of it, thus keeping the anvil a dull black color. When you touch it, you jerk
your hand back, the anvil is extremely cold!

first 1~
Although I am loathe to give you what you want and betray Nimos' trust in me,
it is for the good of my race. Keep in mind that Lady Amber would have better
instructions, for she has done it herself, but I was only guided and even then
was blindfolded. Should you still wish to enter the Citadel despite my warnings
note that it is well protected and has many dead ends, labrynths and endless
corridors. Follow the instructions I give here to the letter, lest your dark
soul be in peril.
First, the Citadel itself is accessable only through a pair of great iron doors
which cannot be opened by any means known to man save with the following
incantation, 'Hovas Nar. Kandra Mil. Volas Nar. Hilasha Mil. Dhrovik!'
These words cause the doors to open. As soon as you enter the Citadel, care
must be taken to say the following word, 'Nyphar' If this word is not 
pronounced upon entry into the Citadel, the place's guards will magically
appear.
~
E
second 2~
The Paths of the Doomed are what leads to Nimos' mansion. They are labyrinthine
and confusing, their exact layout uncertain to me as I was always blindfolded
and sometimes magically incapacitated while we traveled there and I can only
pass on a few of the things which I experienced.
Throughout the maze strange voices jabbered and alien words were given tongue.
In many places I heard the words, barely recognizable, 'In whose name do you
come here?' or 'By what god do you swear?' In most cases the answer was by
fire (or water or earth depending upon the location in the labyrinth), I come
in the name of Nimos. The god worshiped was Nevyn.
~
E
third last 3~
In a chamber filled with the sound of rushing water, I heard the word, 
'thralliq' then the word 'ekkala' Later, in a room that was so hot and stifling
as to be barely habitable, I heart Nimos shout 'khalos' on one occasion and
'olash' soon after. In a room that seemed to be composed of fire I heard,
'Hala vill thora' and the flames ceased to caress my skin. Other phrases and
counter phrases are lost now, swpt away by the memory of the horror which lurks
beyond the Devouring Portal and all the monstrous acts to which I was 
compelled.
This is all I can remember. Again I warn against visiting this cursed place,
but perhaps my description will provide some assistance, already I feel the
weight of the rebirth of my race upon my shoulders.

The Battle of Lost Souls was a great war fought between the evil Gil-Glash's
armies and the armies of the now dead Lothar, who in his time was a very
powerful warrior. Now, no one knows why the battle was started except perhaps
Gil-Glash, who after three centuries still lives, but most think Lothar finally
grew tired of Gil-Glash's reign of tyranny and wanted to put an end to it. But
what is in the past stays in the past, that is not true when dealing with the
battleground the Battle of Lost Souls was fought on, for everywhere lies the
stench of death and travellers that have wandered through tell stories of
great horrors that come out of the earth, pursuing them until they leave the
battleground.

Thus Sumulael and I raised up the inhabitants of Toal from their crypts and
tombs to serve us. We lived there like exiled royalty for many years, until my
husband's insanity and revolting habits grew intolerable. I ended up killing
the monster, eventually with the help of adventurers who had discovered the
secluded city in the wilderness. That is how I met my second husband, Talib.
He was one of the explorers who assisted me in destroying Sumulael and helped
me find my long-sought talisman.

I soon came to love Talib, after a fashion. I taught him all of my hidden
secrets. We were happy together in Toal, rebuilding the city to its former
glory. But in the end, that marriage also failed, for I found that you cannot
practice the Art when you are happy, nor advance in its study if you are
content. So I left behind my beloved, to write this book in solitude and focus
my mind on the difficult road ahead.
~
E
sixth 6~
At first, when my husband and I beheld the bones of the city's former citizens,
we amused ourselves by raising the moldering remains to attend us as ghastly
servants, skeletal porters, and shadowy messengers. When the quest for the
talisman yielded nothing immediately, we animated more of the city's dead to
expand the search. Before long, our new slaves uncovered royal cemeteries
where the kings and queens of Toal had been buried for centuries before the
city's disastrous end. I remember quite vividly my delight at this discovery.
With a wave of my hand, I cracked open the tombs' monolithic stone doors, while
Sumulael, cackling with wicked glee, called forth the city's ancient royalty,
commanding even the oldest of padishahs to stumble forth, wrapped in their
worm-eaten shrouds or burial robes, from the corrupted depths of the crypts
and into our eternal slavery. And while the dead gave up their age-corrupted
treasures, none carried my coveted talisman.
~
E
fifth 5~
  The ruins of Toal were cloaked by the jungle when I rediscovered the broken
city walls with my first husband, Sumulael. That was in the early years of our
marriage, when my devotion to the Forbidden Arts ran strong with the careless
impetuousness of youth. We had been led to the city by disgruntled spirits, in
search of a legendary talisman. Even with our ghostly guides, the ruins of the
vine-choked city were extensive, and the exact location of our prize eluded us.

fourth 4~
Thus the age-old conflict between king and high-priest began again in Uruk,
transplanted from the mainland by its colonists, and it sprang forth anew with
all the vehemence of old. As it destroyed the Old Dynasty, so too did it
unravel the Necromancer Kings. The New Dynasty eventually withered and died,
leaving only mournful spirits to glide over the still black waters by the ruins
of Nycopolis. Now only their histories and their mysterious artifacts remain
as sad, silent testimonies to their former power and glory.
~
E
third 3~
The worship of this forgotten god, known as the Cult of Worms, soon flourished
again under an ambitious priestess named Yola, one of the first nobles to
accompany Ysawis into exile on Uruk. But the King was jealous of Yola's
mounting influence, and he conspired with his most powerful nobles to destroy
her. Yola disappeared soon after from Nycopolis. When she did, the Cult of
Worms floundered without her direction, and Ysawis reigned supreme once again
in his mighty new kingdom of necromancers.
~
E
second 2~
Now, Uruk was not entirely uninhabited when Ysawis founded the New Dynasty. The
colonists found the traces of an even more ancient civilization on the island,
based on the low, sandy shores. They discovered entire ruined cities of antique
metal towers, sundered and dilapidated, lapped along the coast by the hungry
sea. In these mushroom-shaped spires, exotic totems and strange shrines were
unearthed, temples of some forgotten god called the King of Worms, and Lord
over Life and Undeath. Many of the New Dynasty began to worship this ancient
god whose first followers had long since abandoned Uruk to live forever beneath
the cold waves of the sea (or so the ancient legends say).
~
E
book first 1~
Long ago, when the Old Dynasty began to fail on the mainland, Ysawis Ligat was
exiled with a whole cadre of his supporters for practicing deviant and
forbidden magic. Ysawis departed the jungle valleys of his youth in search of
a new home. He crossed the sea and discovered Uruk, a large island of 
mysterious beauty that resembled, in many respects, his beloved homeland.

The island was divided into a low-lying coastal region, an inner high plateau
embraced by jungle, and a high ridge of mountains rising from the center of the
island like the spine of a vishap. On the high plateau, by the shores of a
sepia lake, Ysawis built Nycopolis and made his city the capital of a new
monarchy. He built the Great Summer Palace out of solid ivory and erected a
mighty Colossus in his image to guide visitors safely to his island. Ysawis was
the first and most powerful of the Necromancer Kings, and he ruled Uruk, some
say wisely, for many hundreds of years.
