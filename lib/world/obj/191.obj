It seems to be the journal of an old explorer, you find an interesting
passage:

I have many times heard tales of the legendary Ghost Ship that occasionally
docks in the port cities of Alaozar and Xixieqi. Tonight I shall finally see
if those rumors are true, I shall stake out at the docks north of Alaozar and
try to come aboard the apparition, for I have heard there are hordes of jewels
and artifacts inside the ship's hold. I shall leave this journal with my
friend, who shall warn the populace of the threat that comes so close to home.
