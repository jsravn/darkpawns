This pile is just a massive amount of shrimp, sea bass, crawfish, trout,
perch, flounder, shad, clown shoes, hypodermic needles, and other oceanic
trash caught in nets and piled up here to be dissected later.

Well, well well...This is quite a hat.  It's just a silly cone shaped,
brimless hat.  This is the ultimate in headwear for aspiring young
boys who wish to one day know the pleasure of scrubbing dishes or
digging turnips without pay.  This particular one is shabby and
folded, from the many spankings endured by its original owner.

This cleaver is old and bent, but still incredibly sharp.
The years of its use as a wild instrument of death wielded
by a crazed drunkard have made the cleaver powerful but
extremely inaccurate.

liquor stained collar~
This thing is more trouble than it's worth.  It reeks of alcohol,
and the fumes which rise up when wearing it makes even you a bit
tipsy.  It distracts you greatly in battle and turns you into an
undisciplined fool.  It might be better to just get rid of it.

Maybe it's worth a shot?
