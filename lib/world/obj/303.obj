shoes pair espadrilles canvas~
Traditionally, these shoes were made in two parts, the spun woolen sole made by
the men, and the canvas upper part made by the women. The two parts are then
sewn together by the women, who add an extra patch of wool to the toe.
The quality of these little shoes is the pride of the village's shoemakers.

It is dyed a soft reddish color, probably with dye derived from pokeberry or

Nice pants.

Double stitched with carved tortoise shell buttons, white silk pocket linings,
and even a bronze zipper, the luxury of luxuries for the upper class in this
day and age, these pants surely stand out from the rest. And so does the price

It is rounded in a semi-corner at the edges, and stitched 1/4th inch from the

the scales have folded and rubbed the dye off, leaving off-white circles in the
creases of the belt scales. The sizing holes have brass edges and interlock 
perfectly with the oiled brass buckle.

  It is made of knobby fibrous wood with flaky bark that comes off when you
rub your finger along the rough surface. The leaves are tough and dark green,
shaped almost like a maple leaf but they are covered with short white hairs.
Several different vines branch out of the ground at the same spot, as if a
clump of grapes fell on the ground and sprouted in different directions.

The bark is colored dark reddish-brown and is pruned in many spots, leaving
