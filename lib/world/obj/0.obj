come if summoned...

The book is more a journal than anything else. You skim through it and the
only page of note reads as follows:

"During the daemonic wars of Vymornia, a sanctuary was built high within
the mountains where the mages of the land could develop some form of defense
against the foul beasts. Hidden from the eye of the common man, Stonekeep
was born and although many have sought the secrets it contains, few have
returned to speak of it.

Many years have passed and the land is at peace. The acolytes of the keep
have not been seen for some time and the only evidence that they still
practice their arts is the occassional streak of fire across the sky."
