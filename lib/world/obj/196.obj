statue beautiful woman nat~
The statue is an interpretation of the Goddess Nat. Due to its holy
magnificence, you are unable to determine the material from which it has been
made. She is dressed in nothing but a flowing white robe, her lithe figure
outlined in its silky material. Her long brown hair lies lazily down her back.
She is the quintessence of perfection - she holds in one hand a broken sword
representing peace and in the other hand, three smaller statues.

One is a divine figure dressed in white, wielding a sacred sword with the
writings of Nat inscribed along its shimmering blade. Another, its counterpart,
is dressed in black and wields a long thin blade which appears to be as cold
as ice. The third portrays a younger character whose leather whip drapes at
his side as he looks at you with the eyes of youthful experience and
compassion.

This once cursed monster ruled the seas, from the far east oceans of Zepcaca
to the west of Fentero. Led by Sidious, a crew of Titans vanquished the
powerful creature.

After such a fierce battle, only a few dozen remained standing, their comrades
slain. The corpse of the foul beast was buried within a deep cave never to
be seen again.

It wasn't until 10 years later that the Titans began building a magnificient
castle within this damned, hellish cave.
