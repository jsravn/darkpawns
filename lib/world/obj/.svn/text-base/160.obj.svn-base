titan's mit~
   This large glove is rather bulky and it's doubtful whether your hand can
fit inside it's spacious interior.  The glove has heavily padded segments
to help facilitate free movement of a hand much larger than your own.  Gems
e sparsely embedded on the exterior of the glove, and although you can see
the gems, strangely enough, you can't feel them, much less remove them...

red mushroom~
   This small, red mushroom has a sweet smell to it.  You have a feeling
that this mushroom is indiginous to these mountains, and with that in
consideration, they could have a strange effect on whoever eats them...

lost pack~
  For all intents and purposes, this climber's pack appears normal.  A fine
layer of dust has accumulated on the pack, and suggests that the original
owner has forgotten all about it.

green mushroom~
  This brilliant green mushroom is very exotic looking.  You wager a guess
that this fungus is indiginous to the mountians, and with that in mind,
they could have strange effects on whoever eats them.

husk dried corpse withered~
  Upon closer inspection of this gruesome cadaver, you find that the former
humanoid that should have some heft to it's corpse is rather light, due to
it's insides being sucked dry and leaving the skin dry, wrinkled, cracked,
and leather-like.  Eye sockets holding withered milky looking eyes trap an
immortal look of preternatural horror on the face of this unfortunate
individual.  As the body is moved, you can actually hear it's bones rattling
loosely inside the withered mummified skin.
