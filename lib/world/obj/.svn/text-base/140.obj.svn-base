token~
The token is made of copper, and is very light.  It looks worn from overuse,
but still shines slightly.  You wonder who might have had this token in the
past: perhaps one of the world's greatest combatants.
On the token's front is a picture of a warrior, on the back a logo.

gong~
The gong appears to be made of solid gold, and must weigh over five hundred
pounds.  The arenakeepers have placed it here for your use; if you 'hit' the
'gong', they know you are ready to fight another creature.
