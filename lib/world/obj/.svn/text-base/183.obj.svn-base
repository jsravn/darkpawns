book diary~
                   The Diary of Orodreth the Mage 
The diary mentions Orodreth's addiction to games and puzzles, and his attempts 
to make them life-size. Evidently the black portal here leads to a large 
labyrinth, and the red one leads to a huge checkboard.  Recalling past rumors, 
you remember that after Orodreth found the secret to immortality, his creations 
became infested with evil creatures and warped sentinence.

at the world through rose colored glassed.  Maybe these are those same

piece of glowing rock bestows the blessings of the god Orodreth upon the
bearer. The stone is small, fitting in the palm of your hand- but is
very heavy.  Indecipherable symbols are ornately carved onto the stone.
