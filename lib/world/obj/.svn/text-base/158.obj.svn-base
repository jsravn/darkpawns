book necromancer leather~
Flicking through the pages, you begin to feel sick at some of the things
this book contains. It contains a number of spells, most of them so powerful
they were long ago banned by the magic users of the land. However, someone
here is still using them and you have every right to be afraid. Each of the
spells within the book uses live components, body parts from all manner of
creatures.
