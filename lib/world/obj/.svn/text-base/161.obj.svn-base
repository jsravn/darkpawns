with an ethereal brightness.  All manner of evil seem to shrink away from 
this extraordinary item made for the defenders of good and righteousness...

blue axe~
  A double-bladed battle axe.  The axe's blade is made from some otherworldly
blue metal, with serpentine designs etched across the blade's face, and 
spiralling down the axe's shaft toward the handle.  The handle itself seems
to have a grip and heft just right for you, which you find to be rather odd,
considering the immensity of the blade.
