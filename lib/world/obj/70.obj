weapon sure knows his craft.

rapier~
Carefully crafted, this slender weapon is ineffectual in the hand of the
uninitiated, and deadly in the hands of the skilled. Made of many layers
of folded steel, the strength of the thin blade is surprisingly resilient.
A fine wire-mesh basket protects the hands of the wielder and provides
a guard with which to break the opponents blade. There is an inscriptions
along the blade.
