The Ice Box~
   Here lie the frozen remains of mud players who just couldn't play with
the other kids in the sandbox.

The Board Room Of The Immortals~
   This large room is well-decorated, and lit from above by a soft
magical glow of no particular origin.  Scattered around the room are
comforable chairs and piles of furs of various dimension, and in the
very middle there is a huge oaken table that shimmers in an odd manner.
A large picture window looks down over the whole world, showing the
exploits of the many intrepid mortals.  A spiral staircase leads down
to another part of this room.  There is a sign hovering in the 
awesomeness of this room.

The Lower Board Room of the Immortals~
  This room is a close twin to the main Immortal Board Room at the top of the
spiral staircase.  Your mind and body cannot help but relax as you gaze
around this comfortable room, and hope that you will be able to linger here
a while.  Many green plants line a marble stairway that leads down to the 
Temple of Kir Drax'in.

Steam Chamber~
  You come to rest in a large circular chamber whose ceiling extends upward far
beyond your range of vision.  The smooth rock walls curve slowly upward in a
cork-screw fashion, allowing the the massive amount of steam rushing in from the
south to be vented upwards into the darkness.  A large ring of metal has been
set into the floor of this room, binding the elemental energy that dwells here.

The Vent~
  You look up to see a massive fissure in the rock wall above you venting a
torrent of hot steam in massive waves directly towards you!  Unable to react, 
you find yourself lifted off of your feet and hurled backward away from the fissure
with hot steam and water scalding your flesh almost instantaneously.  You begin
to loose conciousness - this may be the end.

Blackness~
  You step into total darkness and vertigo immediately sets in.  Without any
feeling or sense of direction it is impossible to know if you are standing still
or falling rapidly to your doom.  Desperately, you grope around and cry out into
the blackness to no avail until suddenly you feel bathed in the sound and fury
of hot, rushing air...

Lava Tube~
The narrow lava tube abruptly ends here, expanding into a chamber so large that
you cannot see the walls, floor or ceiling.  Hot wind rushes quickly somewhere
below your perch on a small ledge at the precipice of this cavern - you can feel
the radiant heat on your skin and hear the drone of the wind as it passes over
the rocks below.  Inky blackness surrounds you.

Lava Tube~
  The narrow walls of the lava tube grip your body claustrophobically as you 
slide along them.  The tube seems to follow a north-south path, gradually sloping
southward, where you can hear the sound of wind rushing along the rock walls.

Lava Tube~
  The lava tube here is incredibly narrow, forcing you to hold your breath in
an effort to squeeze through.  The walls of volcanic rock are sharp and unyielding
against your exposed flesh.  The tube slopes upward to the north and downward to
the south.

Lava Tube~
  You stand in a small, spherical cavern made up of hard, black rock.
Your surmise that this must be the end of an ancient lava tube.  The rock walls
of the cavern and slighly shiny and shimmer in the meager light your lanterns
provide. The only apparent path is that of the old lava tube, a smooth and
narrow passage that drops away to your south.
