Noirwood Forest~
   You are standing at what seems to be the edge of the vast forest known as
Noirwood to the orcs. Just north of here, you see a huge expanse of grassy
fields looming over a lake.
   You can continue along the lakeside to the north or enter the forest to
the south, where a streamlet enters the woods and forms its western border.

woodland mammal eyeing you in a tall tree above your head.  This vast forest 
seems to continue forever in any direction you look.

This seemingly boundless, evil woodland is known as Noirwood -- which, in

seem to emit a rank, yellowish mist.  Every once in a while you think you 
sense something following you.  For as far as the eye can see these gloomy 
woods continue in every direction.

Here, somewhere at the heart of Noirwood forest, the evil trees grow lofty 
and completely block the light.  The tall trees which reach up towards the 
heavens in these parts are dark and appear to be very old.  A thin, white 
fog rises from the soggy earth into the insect-filled air in these parts.

The air here near the middle of the vast, shadow-filled woodland is hot and
difficult to breathe.   Some kind of brown-green fine dust in the heavy air
in this part of the forest make it smelly.   You notice a little woodland
mammal looking at you in a strong tree above your head.   The strong, gloomy
trees all around you are just as thick as those in this general area.

Noirwood Forest~
You stand amidst the lofty, dark trees in the evil forest the orcs call
Noirwood.   The tall trees in this area completely block out the light and
fill the insect-filled air with pollen making it rank.   There are many odd
plants on the hard ground in this general area.   This seemingly endless
forest seems to continue forever in any direction you look.

You are standing at the heart of this mystical woodland and are surrounded
totally by strong, shadow-filled trees.   The black trees growing in this
part of the forest look very old and healthy.   You note a quick woodland
animal studying you in a lofty tree above your head.   In this seemingly
boundless, dark woodland the lofty trees seem to continue forever in any
direction you look.

which, in orcish, means Black Woods.   You notice that the lofty, 
enchanted trees here look old and seem to fill the heavy air with 
a rotten-grey mist.   Every few minutes you perceive a tiny forest 
animal running about in a dark tree.   The strong, dark trees in 
every direction are just as thick as those around here.

Here, somewhere near the middle of Noirwood forest, the 
mystical trees grow tall and utterly block the light.   Some kind 
of brown-green pollen in the hot air around here make it difficult 
to breathe.   There are a couple of odd-looking plants on the 
soggy earth in these parts.   For as far as the eye can see these 
evil woods continue in any direction you look.

Noirwood Forest~
Here, somewhere near the middle of Noirwood forest, the dark 
trees grow strong and totally obstruct the light.   The tall trees 
which reach up towards the heavens in these parts are black and 
appear to be ancient.   There are a few odd plants on the hard 
forest floor in this vicinity.   For as far as the eye can see 
these evil woods continue in any direction you look.

Noirwood Forest~
You are standing somewhere near the middle of the seemingly 
boundless, dark woodland called the Noirwood.   The gloomy, strong 
trees around here seem to emit a smelly, rotten-grey fine dust.   
There are a couple of large plants on the hard ground in this 
vicinity.   The tall, mystical trees in any direction you look are 
just as thick as those in this part of the forest.

Noirwood Forest~
You are standing somewhere in the center of the vast, 
enchanted forest called the Noirwood.   You perceive that the 
lofty, enchanted trees in this general area look ancient and seem 
to fill the hot air with a brown-green fine dust.   You may be 
crazy but few minutes you swear you hear merry-making and musical 
instruments far away.   In this seemingly boundless, enchanted 
woodland the strong trees seem to continue forever in every 
direction.

You are standing at the heart of this shadow-filled forest

rises from the leaf covered forest floor into the heavy air around 
here.   In this huge, shadow-filled woodland the lofty trees seem 
to continue forever in any direction you look.

The seemingly endless, gloomy forest in which you stand is 
known as Noirwood by the locals.   You note that the lofty, gloomy 
trees in this part of the forest seem to be old and seem to fill 
the thick air with a rotten-grey fine dust.   A heavy, grey fog 
rises from the moss covered earth into the heavy air here.

Noirwood Forest~
   This large, dark forest is called Noirwood -- which, in orcish, means Black
Woods.   You perceive that the lofty, shadow-filled trees in this part of the
forest seem to be ancient and seem to fill the air with a rotten-grey dust.
   Wisps of fog come in off the ocean to the south, filling the air with
a dampness that seems to mould the trees and rocks around you.  The forest
continues to the north and west and an impassible jumble of rocks falls away
into the ocean to the east.
