Guard Barracks~
   You are in the foyer of the barracks of the city guard.  A pair of
large iron-bound oak doors lead south into a room marked "Training area".
A large board with several recruitment posters hangs on the eastern wall
above a small wooden desk.  The rest of the barracks are off-limits to
civilians such as yourself.

The New Recruit Training Area~
   Several people are wandering around here, obviously new recruits 
waiting to be sent into training for the city guard. The large open
area extends to the east. A large set of oak doors is to the north.

   This is the northwest corner of the second level of the training centre.
A flight of stairs leads back up to level one, and the second level extends 
to your south and east.  The trainees on this level wear white outfits and
practice the basics of hand-to-hand combat.

level is to the northwest, but all there is is open space with trainees in
white jumpsuits practicing hand-to-hand combat on straw mats which have
been placed on the floor.

Kir Drax'in Guard Basic Training - Level Two~
   This is a corner of the second level of the guard training centre, where 
men in white jumpsuits practice beating each other up with their hands.  You
imagine that this is pretty good practice for the real world, unless their
assailant is armed, of course.

Kir Drax'in Guard Basic Training - Level Three~
   You stand at the bottom of stone steps which lead up to the second
level.  The third level of the training centre stretches out to your
southwest, with trainees in green outfits practicing combat with the
typical standard-issue Kir Drax'in Guard sabers.  You notice that the
sabers appear to have been dulled; they are clearly not meant to wound
the opponent, mortally or otherwise.

Kir Drax'in Guard Basic Training - Level Three~
   This is the northwest corner of the third level of the training centre.  
All around you, men in green armor attempt to slice one another with ill-
manufactured weaponry.  You notice, however, that some of the sabers are
sharp enough to cut, judging by the minor gashes on some of the men.
   These guys must be pretty serious about serving in the guard to go 
through this kind of exercise.

Kir Drax'in Guard Basic Training - Level Three~
  This is the southwest corner of the third level.  Here, a flight of stone 
steps leads down to level four, where you can hear the loud clanging of 
what sounds like real combat.  The third level extends to your northeast, 
amid a sea of green-armored trainees.

   This is the southeast corner of the third level.  Many trainees in green 
armor battle each other with sabers, while being instructed in the finer
points of bladed combat by large officers whose duty it is to train new
recruits.  The third level extends to your northwest.

Kir Drax'in Guard Basic Training - Level Four~
   This is the beginning of the fourth level of the guard training center, a 
flight of stairs leads back up to level three here.  This level seems to have 
split the men from the boys; you notice that all the recruits here seem to be
bigger and tougher looking than those on the floors above.  Their training
must be close to complete.  This level extends to the southeast.

   This is the southwest corner of the fourth level of the Kir Drax'in Guard 
training centre.  This level is much the same as the ones above, except that
the men here are wearing brown armor are seem much more vicious than the
ones on the floors above.  These guys almost look like they could be members
of the church guard.

Kir Drax'in Guard Basic Training - Level Four~
   You stand in the northeast corner of the fourth floor.  All around you, 
men in brown armor are gritting their teeth in combat against one another,
using the standard weaponry of the church guard: polearms and sabers. The
sabers are pretty dull, of course, but the polearms look like they hurt,
and make a sickening smacking sound when they connect with one of their
opponents heads.  The fourth floor extends to your southwest.

stairs leading down to what must be the fifth level, and you notice that 
only the heartiest and strongest men are allowed to pass down them.  Maybe
you could sneak by and see what is down there?

The Fifth Level~
   The walls of this room have been painted matte black, and very little 
light reflects off them from the two large torches that barely seem to
illuminate this room.  Occasionally, a warrior from above descends the
stairs and enters through the doorway to the south.  However, the door
itself is guarded by a particularly menacing guard, and you doubt he'll
let you by if he doesn't think you are worthy.  Above the door there is
an inscription that reads: "Indoctrination Centre".

The Indoctrination Centre~
   This is apparently where the trainees become fully inducted in to the 
Kir Drax'in Guard.  There are trainees waiting in line to receive their
standard issue weapons to the east, and their armor to the west. The 
main centre extends to the south, and to the north through a heavily
guarded doorway.  This room is decorated with religious icons and 
candles, and some new initiates to the guard kneel in prayer before 
proceeding to the south.

   This is where the new members of the Kir Drax'in guard are fitted for 
their standard issue armor.  A young priest hands out the armor to the 
new initiates that are waiting in line. Written on the wall are the ten 
commandments of the Kir Drax'in guard, and other religious propaganda.
The centre continues to the east.

Weapons Depot~
   In this room a line of new guard members wait for their standard issue 
sabers. These men have been picked out of hundreds of trainees to defend
Kir Drax'in against the monsters of the Wyldlands.  They are chosen not
only for their ability to fight, but for their ability to be programmed,
zealous defenders of the church.  You sure as hell hope they are ready.
The centre continues to the west.

Indoctrination Centre~
   This is apparently the final room in the complex, as you see the new 
fully-armored guards of Kir Drax'in march through a stone archway and
ascend a flight of stairs to your south.  As they pass through this room,
a member of the clergy bestows their holy orders upon them.  You realize
that these new guards are not just guardians of the city, but guardians
of the church as well.

Guard Barracks~
   You are inside the Barracks of the Kir Drax'in Guard, just north of the
reception foyer.  This is apparently where the new initiates go to get their
assignments, although it seems rather vacant right now.  As soon as you
step out of the stairwell, some priests close and bar the door behind you,
to prepare for the next batch of initiates.  It appears that the only
way out is south into the reception foyer.
