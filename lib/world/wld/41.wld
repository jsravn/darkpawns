In the Lakeshore Tavern~
   You are standing in the common room of the Lakeshore Tavern. The rough -
hewn walls of stone hold many portraits of heroes and legends from the
past. Maybe one day, you could have your portrait here too. The tables
and chairs surrounding you look comfortable and inviting, but not as
inviting as the roaring fireplace to the east.  
   To the southeast, a bar where one can order drinks or food seats 
thirsty patrons.

In the Lakeshore Tavern~
   You are standing before a roaring fireplace in the Lakeshore
Tavern. The warmth of the fireplace is very comforting, as is the
general atmosphere of the tavern. It's no mystery as to why so
many people like to come here.
   Just south of here, the back door of the tavern leads out to
the docks.

On the Docks at the Lakeshore Tavern~
   You are standing on the old wooden docks just behind the Lakeshore
Tavern.  Looking out east over the beautiful Lake Kialoren, you can
only wonder at the majesty that is nature. The fast flowing Bhyroga
River flows into the lake just north of you. To the south, you can
see the back door of the Lakeshore Tavern.

served.
   To the north, a cozy fireplace is embedded in the wall.

In the Lakeshore Tavern~
   The common room bustles with life and looks very much as if it never
dies.  The wooden spiral stairs leading up to the second floor here seem
like they've been here for centuries, but they're just as firm as when
they were first put in. A welcoming bar to the east offers refreshment.

In the Lakeshore Tavern~
   You are standing beside the bar inside the common room of the Lakeshore
Tavern.  The worn and polished bar looks grand, despite its age. The aged
innkeeper stands behind the bar, directing his workers with a kind, but 
firm tone of voice.  Waitresses walk in and out of the door to the east
that leads to the kitchen.
