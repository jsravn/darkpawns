In a Narrow Valley~
Not much more than a crack in the face of the mountain, this narrow
valley takes a sharp turn to the south, opening into a dark cave.

Entrance Passage~
As you approach the cave-mouth, everything seems quiet. A high passage runs
a few paces into the rock of the valley-side before turning to the left and
going out of sight. The passage is tall enough for a giant to pass through.

Guard Room~
This is a large cave with a half-dozen piles of filthy straw and other 
materials toward the east end. One passage leads off to the north, and another
to the west.

Junction Cave~
This medium-sized cave has passages leading off from it in all directions. The
cave is scattered with a half-dozen piles of straw and rubbish.

Food Storage~
This small cave has only one obvious exit. The far end of the cave is piled
with animal carcasses, chunks of meat, and other unidentified objects. The
stench in here is overpowering, and the heap of food is covered with small
beetles, worms and other lowlife.

Slave Pens~
This chamber is rectangular, and has clearly been carved out of the living
rock. There are doors in the north, east and south walls. Huddled in the room
are several ragged, starved-looking men, chained together and watched over by
two ogres.

Slave Mine~
This rectangular chamber is largely artificial, although the back wall is
rough-hewn. A crew of ragged, sick-looking men toils feebly under the direction
of an ogre slave-driver. Here and there, reddish glowing objects hang on the
wall, casting a fitful and gloomy light on the scene.

Passage~

giant would not have to stoop to get through.

Beetle Farm~
This narrow chamber is lit by a reddish glow. The floor is covered by a thick
layer of debris, and you can see several huge beetles -- each nearly a yard 
long -- moving about in the rubbish. Each beetle has three glowing lights --
one on either side of the head, and one near the back of it's abdomen.

Slave Workshop~
This rectangular chamber appears to be a workshop of some kind. There is a
furnace and anvil on one side, and a range of workbenches against the opposite
wall. Two starved-looking men work at the furnace under the stern eyes of an
ogre slave-driver.

Ogre Communal Area~
This large, irregular cavern has a number of exits. The floor is littered with
gnawed bones and other debris. A group of ogres are gathered around some kind
of disturbance in the middle of the cavern, jabbering excitedly in their own
tongue.

Passage~
This passage seems to be artificial, for it is perfectly straight along the
middle and the walls, floor and ceiling are smooth. But it's ceiling is very
high -- again, high enough for an ogre to walk through with ease but low
enough for a giant to have to stoop.

This cavern is irregular in shape, narrowing slightly in the middle, and making
a hourglass figure. The back of the room is very dark, and you wonder what it
is that makes it a home.

Chieftain's Antechamber~
This chamber is rounded, with one exit to the east and one to the north. Two
scarred and strong-looking goblins stand beside the northern exit, which has
a rich tapestry of elvish designs hung upside-down across it. The ogres snarl
and draw their weapons as you enter.

Ogre Emperor's Chamber~
This oval chamber is luxuriously-appointed compared with the rest of the
complex. It looks like all the rugs, tapestries, and other soft furnishings
were stolen from the elvish kingdoms. They are scattered around the cave,
and a mound of them against the back wall presumably serves the Ogre Emperor
for a bed.

Secret Room~
This room is where the ogre shaman hides his valuables that he doesn't wish
to share with the Emperor. On hooks along one wall hang several ornate ogre-
sized robes worked with gold and silver thread. A small chest stands beside
them and, next to the chest, two staves lean against the wall.

Shrine~
This chamber is part natural and part artificial. There are two exits -- one
in the west wall and one in the east wall. The walls have been crudely drawn
on by the ogres, using mud and other, more aromatic, substances. The altar
in the center of the shrine has been chipped, and a skull rests beside it.

and a desk and some shelves stand opposite. The contents of the desk and
shelves are now strewn across the floor, but the furniture is undamaged.

Gladiatorial Pit~
This cavern has been hewn into a roughly square shape, and has a narrow
walkway around a deep pit in the middle of the room; a rail prevents clumsy
observers from easily falling into the pit. There are traces of dried blood,
bones, broken weapons, and other debris in the sand and gravel at the bottom
of the pit.
