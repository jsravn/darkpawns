In a Marsh~
The ground becomes ever softer and yeilds and springs with every step.
Mosquitoes buzz in your ear and find even the smallest chink in your armor to
bite at the tender flesh underneath. A nauseating stench comes from the 
south, heralding the start of a swamp. To the east and west huge ironwood 
trees can be seen rising up into the sky.

The Swamp~
The solid ground of the forest gives way to a wet spongy terrain. The
ground squishes under each footfall and the thoguht of falling through is
first in mind. The trees are becoming slightly more spread out, but the
maze of roots coming from them more than makes up for any difference in 
ease of passage. The sounds of moving water come from the east. To the south
the swamp seems to be getting more dense.

to the north. To the west the swamp thickens with fog.

The Swamp~
The swamplands border the forest here; the tall trees block your view of the 
horizon to the north and west. Southeast of here the dismal swamp beckons
to you with the hoarse cries of bullfrogs... and strong sense of evil.

The Swamp~
The fast flowing niche to the east deposits you into this relatively 
slow flowing pond. Everywhere small tributaries deposit their loads from 
the river into this area. Every direction is open for travel. To the north
it looks as though it may get drier.

The Swamp~
The fast flowing water to the east seems to have carved a small canal
into the swamp at this point. The water funnels into this canal bringing 
you along for the ride. The movement through this passage is quite fast and
keeping from tipping over on slightly submerged roots is of top priority. 
After the small passage the water opens into the stillness of the open swamp

The Swamp~
To the west the tall spires of trees saturate your view, it looks as 
thought the swamp borders up to a forest in that direction. Every other 
direction seems to look the same, swamp. Here and there a small frog pops 
its head from the water and croaks at you.

The water here begins to slow and calm itself now that it's out of the fast-

of trees. The closer you get the more dense the foliage hanging from the trees
becomes. Branches are slapping you in the face as you try to push them out of

of the swamp lays behind you.

new life springs forth. Besides the sound of water from the east there is no
noise that greets your ears. The swamp is suspiciously silent.

  As you enter this room, the first thing you notice is the practically
unbearable stench; you almost retch at the thought of what could make such a
foul odor.  The second thing you notice is the source of the smell -- bodies,
at least twenty of them, with their rib cages ripped open so wide they look
like some twisted mockery of angels. There is nothing inside the carcasses,
their insides are strewn across a bloody stone altar in the center of the
room.
