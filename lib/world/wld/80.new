You are at the northern part of the wall that surrounds the city. To the south
lies the massive spire-topped temple, and to the east and west the wall bends
southward. The rough chiseled stone of the wall rises high above you, but to
the east you can see a few treetops above the bits of glass and pottery inset
into the wall's top surface.

At the Temple Altar~
You stand before the temple altar. Carved from a solid block of black marble,
it is an exquisite example of dwarven craftsmanship. Black pillars of the same
marble hold up the ceiling of this open-aired pavilion, and to the south a
narrow aisle runs its way between hard oaken pews. Below you, you can see the
entrance to the Kir Drax'in Training Center.
