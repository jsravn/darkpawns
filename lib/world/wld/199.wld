Entrance of a Narrow Pass~
To the south you can pass between two unclimbable rock mountain faces. The
narrow pass there looks like it opens up into a treeless clearing.

In the Narrow Pass~
Towering shale cliffs on either side of you seem to threaten an avalanche at
an moment. Even as you think it, a few pebbles tumble down as if brushed loose
by something high above.

On a Rocky Ledge~
The trail leads north here, and the slippery cliff face looks climbable above
you. A dark cave to the south is almost no more than a deep niche in the
side of the mountain, but you can squeeze through. The sun can't quite
reach this slope, and a bitter cold wind sweeps into the links in your
armor.

faintly with a green light that seems to be emitted by a spongy mold that
grows on the walls.
