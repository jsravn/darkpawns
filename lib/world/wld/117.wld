Entrance to the Crystal Temple~
Before you a huge building towers over the horizon. It looks ancient beyond
belief, and the signs of the altar and holy flame above the door and on the
gables show it to be a temple. The entire building is made of some slick black
stone, possibly onyx.

The Secret Room~
The southern wall of this room is dark onyx which shows up like a dirty stain
against the other three clear crystal walls. The door that was hidden from the
outside is plainly visible on this side, leading south out into the

It is the color of a bleached skull, his flesh; and the long hair which flows

two slanting eyes, crimson and moody, and from the solid sleeves of his yellow
robe emerge two slender hands, also the color of bone, resting on each arm of
a seat which has been carved from a single, massive ruby. This is truly a
beautiful likeness.

The Alcove~
This small room is no larger than a broom closet. On the wall hangs a long
tapestry.

You see a faded tapestry picturing the god Tracer looking evilly down on the

A narrow path~
Flames lick up on both sides of the path. The yawning chasm beneath
your feet promises certain death should you fall.

A narrow path~
Ahead lies the end of the path. The flame roaring below obscures any sound,
and its smoke obscures your sight of what lies before you.

A lair above the lava~
The path to the south ends here on a smooth stone pedestal. All around you
fire leaps and crackles fiercely.

An endless chasm doesn't really seem plausible.. Perhaps you'll hit
bottom in a few weeks, if you don't starve to death or burn to a crisp

In any case.... You're dead.
