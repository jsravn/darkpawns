Entering a Dim Street~
   While most city streets are clean and well maintained, the street here
has taken a turn for the worse. Looking ahead, you can see that the street
doesn't get any better, worse in fact. There is a sign fastened securely
to the wall of a building.

WARNING: You are entering the slums. The Church has condemned the area and

own risk. Under no circumstances should you consider yourself safe within
these diseased walls.

A Dim Street~
   Proceeding deeper into the slums, the street narrows and begins to
twist and turn. Rubbish lies strewn about randomly, sometimes threatening
to topple down upon you. It would be easy to get lost here.

A Dim Street~
   It is said that this section is the oldest part of town. It certainly
looks like it now. Poorly constructed houses line the street, sometimes
two stories high, and garbage is a continual threat to life.

A Blocked Street~
   As the road continues, little changes beside the direction you are 
going.  Ahead, the burnt remains of a building are piled in the street
blocking your way south. From all appearances, houses have been built
haphazardly upon the ruined foundations of others.

   Charred bricks and wood lay scattered about in small pieces. It feels
weird walking through the remains of this building.  You wonder what caused
the fire and more importantly why it didn't consume this entire section of
town.

floorboards.  Best not to dally too long.

The Plated Ingot~
   In direct contrast to the rest of this part of the city, this room is 
clean, warm, and well lit. The lighting is provided by what appears to be
magical globes hung on chandeliers. On the north wall is a fireplace that
blazes heartily.  To your right, a bar lies along the west wall.  Across
many tables and clouds of pipe and other smoke is a doorway through which
you can hear occasional snatches of conversation. The bar continues south.

The Plated Ingot~
   Most of the people in the tavern have congregated in this end of the
room. The lighting here is a bit dimmer. Given the nature of this part
of the town, you would expect the patrons to be more wary, yet most look
fairly relaxed. The bar along the west wall is made of sturdy ironwood 
from the surrounding forests of Kir Drax'in. Behind the bar is a doorway
through which the smells of fine foods waft. On the east side of the room
is a closed door. Along the south wall a set of stairs leads up.

which a huge slab of spiced meat lies steaming. On the west wall is a medium-
sized hole with shutters on either side.

Gambling room~
   Low-hung, dim lights hang over assorted small gambling tables. You can
see a variety of card games going on, a game of sherpa, as well as several
dice games. It's hard to make out any faces in the crowd due to the precise
positioning of the lighting in addition to the volume of smoke. The little
conversation you hear seems sporadic and muted, with only occasional rowdy
outbursts.

Scattered about the roof are several plants of unknown variety. There
appears to be some sort of force field just above this area.

Narrow Plank~
   You teeter upon a wobbly narrow plank which spans the short distance
between buildings. Looking down into the blackness causes your gluteus
maximus to pucker, your liver to rise into your throat, and your vision
to dance a nifty number. Walk nimbly!

Gutted Hotel~
   The entire place has been gutted and turned into a lotus den. The stench
is overpowering to those with any sense left.  Of course those with any
sense wouldn't be here anyway.

An Empty Hovel~
   Once a home to many by the appearance of this single room makeshift
building.  The walls are constructed of many different materials: the
floor is dirt.  Garbage lies scattered about the room and there is a
long-neglected fire pit in one corner.

chairs and coat hooks, and a solid utilitarian desk, but nothing else.
The entire room is covered in dust.

A Common Room~
   This area appears to be a common eating/cooking room.  Several food
and drink-stained tables stand near the center of the room.  The flooring
in this room consists of raised planking.  Along the north wall is a hot
fireplace and kitchen area for preparation of food.

Lounge/Study~
   Like the receiving room, this room sports fabulous items from around
the world.  Several paintings adorn the walls, statues and statuettes
are scattered here and there, and fine hand-woven rugs line the floors.
Along the north wall is a hardwood bar and nicely stocked liquor cabinet.
To the east is a heavy, carved door.

Master Bedroom~
   Opulence takes on new meaning here.  Silks and velvets cover just about
everything, including a huge four-poster canopy bed.  An armoire laden with
fine clothing rests along the east wall.  A dressing table and full-length
mirror occupies the north wall.  The huge bed consumes almost the entire
room with it's headboard against the south wall.

A Freshly Dug Cellar~
   This room appears to have been recently dug.  Touching the walls causes
dirt to crumble, cascading down into a little pile at your feet.  Probably
shouldn't do that.  Some rough timbers have been placed around the room to
attempt support.

   You pause on a softly lit landing, plush carpet squishing softly beneath
your tired feet. Over the typical sounds of the bar, you can hear the softer
sounds of muted conversation above. Inhaling the air, you catch subtle scents
of perfume.
