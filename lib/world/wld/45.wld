A Turn in the Labyrinth~
   The stone corridor curves east and south here. From somewhere in the
distance, you hear the sound of a large roaring, as if from some great
beast.

A Large Room in the Labyrinth~
   This large room is seemingly hollowed out of solid stone, but by whose
hand is unknown.  The craftsmanship looks nothing like the careful work of
dwarves, nor does it look like it was done by any type of tool you've ever
seen. It almost looks CLAWED out by something. Eyeing the debris on the 
floor in front of you, you feel like this is the home of that something.
