A Clearing In The Forest Arden~
  You stand in a small clearing in the huge and primal forest of
Arden. All other forests you've ever seen were mere shadows of this
great wood. It appears dangerous and is rumoured to be the favorite
hunting grounds of Julian, a Prince of Amber. Beware that you don't
become his prey.

This is a shrine to a unicorn. Legend has it that the creator of Amber

came here with the Jewel of Judgement and used it to inscribe The Pattern
into the bedrock of reality. Dworkin then, as the story goes, mated with
the unicorn (the physical incarnation of The Pattern) to produce a son,
Oberon. Oberon ruled Amber for eons and sired many sons. Julian was one.
Random was another and now rules by the choice of the unicorn itself.

altar~
If Amber has such a thing as a patron saint, the unicorn is it. In fact,
rumor has it that the founder of all order in the universe and creator
of Amber, Dworkin of Chaos, mated with the unicorn. The fruit of that

Random, and the other princes of Amber.

by someone comfortably buried beneath the sheets and pillows.
There's a huge picture window to the south, a fireplace to the east, and
bookshelves everywhere else. Thick bear skins cover the floor. A Macintosh

Choice looks like she's sound asleep in that comfy bed. She was developed
into an ultrahuman by the Choice Corporation as a spokesperson and
ultraheroine. Much to their chagrin, she was her own woman and left
their employ. She's also one of the most beautiful women you've ever
seen. A magnificent brunette with an awesome figure. Her usual costume
is no where in sight. She looks delicious. You wonder where Hardcase is...

Julian~
Here is the passive contenance of Julian, dark hair hanging long,
blue eyes containing neither passion nor compassion. He is dressed
in scaled white armor.
~
E
gerard~
A big and powerful man regards you from this tapestry. He strongly
resembles Corwin but is much heavier. His strength is legendary. He
wears a dressing gown of blue and gray clasped about the middle witH
a wide, black belt. From about his neck, on a heavy cord, hangs a
silver hunting horn. He wears a fringe beard and a light mustache and
a laugh upon his lips. He is Gerard.
~
E
bleys~
Fiery bearded, flame-crowned Bleys, dessed all in red and orange,
eyes as blue as Flora's or Eric's. He word two huge rings on his
right hand and one on his left: an emerald, a ruby, and a sapphire.
~
E
benedict~
Here is Benedict, tall and dour, thin; thin of body, thin of face,
wide of mind. He wears orange and yellow and brown, and reminds you
of haystacks and pumpkins and scarecrows and the Legend of Sleepy
Hollow. He has a strong jaw and hazel eyes and brown hair that never
curls.
~
E
eric~
A tapestry of Eric, handsome by anyone's standards, his hair so dark
as to be nearly blue. His beard curls around a mouth that always
smiles and he is dressed simply in a leather jacket and leggings; a
plain cloak and high black boots.
~
E
random~
Random is a wily-looking man, with a sharp nose and a laughing mouth
and a shock of straw-colored hair. He is dressed in something like
a Renaissance costume of orange, red, and brown. A section of the
tapestry appears to have been knitted in later. It shows Random's hand
holding a crown and a huge ruby on a chain.

                             THE PATTERN

 The Pattern was forged by the ancient mage Dworkin, who fled from the
Courts of Chaos with the Jewel of Judgment. Using the jewel, Dworkin
created the Pattern and order was formed out of the chaotic state of the
universe. Two major religious factions argue over the primacy of the
Pattern that lies beneath the Castle Amber. One says that it is the very
Pattern that Dworkin forged and, thus, is the primal Pattern. The other
says that the Pattern below the castle is the first shadow of the primal
Pattern, which is elsewhere.
 Descendants of Dworkin can walk the Pattern and survive (although it is
difficult and dangerous for them) and gain the power to walk through
Shadow. The Pattern is almost always lethal to any who attempt to walk
it who are not of the royal blood.

                                    AMBER

 Amber is the primal city of the universe. All other worlds you've seen or
will ever see are merely shadows of Amber. Therefore, everything, and more,
is here that is anywhere else. The one other place that is 'original' in
the universe is the Courts of Chaos. Lying on the extreme other edge of
Shadow from Amber, little is known of it.

weddings, coronations, and funerals occur here. On the south wall, doorways
lead to sitting rooms, while on the north wall two doors lead to a corridor
near the kitchen. A bar stands in the northwest corner. Light comes through
beveled windows from 25 feet up the west wall. The effect is almost prismatic
and the Hall takes on a beautiful, hypnotic shimmer. The deep green vein in
the white marble walls seems to slither its way from the ceiling to the floor.
Under a bright moon, the vein is predominant. The Great Hall at night is
eerie.

The Northeast Corner Of The Great Hall~
  The Great Hall measures approximately 50 feet wide by 90 feet long. Its
beamed and plastered ceiling is almost 40 feet above the floor. Royal
weddings, coronations, and funerals occur here. On the south wall, doorways
lead to sitting rooms, while on the north wall two doors lead to a corridor
near the kitchen. A bar stands in the northwest corner. Light comes through
beveled windows from 25 feet up the west wall. The effect is almost prismatic
and the Hall takes on a beautiful, hypnotic shimmer. The deep green vein in
the white marble walls seems to slither its way from the ceiling to the floor.
Under a bright moon, the vein is predominant. The Great Hall at night is
eerie.

Flora's Bath~
   One of the most outlandish baths you've ever seen, it carries the
French-style decor into its historically weakest area. Little, cute
statues spout water into a large, shell-shaped tub. The fixtures are
gold on the sink, toilet, and - what's that thing? Oh, a bidet.

at its base, proclaiming that whatever lies outside the pattern is deadly.

The Armory~
  This is a clean looking shop which sports a foundry in the back, they
must make all these armors in house, instead of trading for them. Most
of the pieces are complete suits designed specifically for the royal family
of Amber, but it looks like the blacksmith has enough talent to repair or
replace any armor you can specify.

Stven's Armaments~
  This store contains a wide variety of swords, axes, and other weaponry
that a soldier or adventurer might purchase.  Most of the armaments are
displayed on the walls or hung from the ceiling, you'd hate to be nearby
if any of those swords hung from the crossbeam fell.
