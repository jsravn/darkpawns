An Immortal Room~
This is a starting point for all of us who don't need doors or walkways to get
around.  There is a map floating in the nothingness here for some guidance.

A Foreboding Cave Entrance~
   An unusally dark cave opening looms to your north, its wall covered in
strange writings, few of which you can comprehend.  There are two tall pikes
on each side of the cave entrance, topped with human skulls.  You get the
feeling that you are not welcome here.

There are only a few words written in common on the wall. The boldest and
most notable one reads 'Danger' in large script.

skulls~
Strips of flesh and bits of hair hang off them, telling you that these
skulls on pikes were once human heads on pikes.

A Peaceful Meditation Room~
The cave here has an unusually peaceful and relaxed feeling.  A comfortable
mat lies in front of a bookcase on the north wall.  A ninja's book of
meditations lies open on the mat, suggesting that the owner has been here
recently; perhaps it would be best to leave before he returns.

The Chamber of Wisdom~
A surprisingly well-lit room surrounds you.  There are no visible torches or
even signs of magical intervention, but there is more than enough light to see
clearly.  An open book stands on a pedestal in the center of the room, with
some neat writing, which appears to read: 'Through conquest comes knowledge.'

Inside the Golden Pyramid~
You are now inside the golden pyramid. The walls appear to be constructed from
solid gold. A pungent green smoke fills the air, choking your lungs and leaving
you confused. You can hear strange singing from an unknown direction, some
type of folk music. On the floor lay three golden lamps, each emblazoned with
an apple.

The Gallery~
This is where the inhabitants apparently hold all important meetings. Topless
women stand in all corners of the room, standing so still you almost didn't
realize they were real. A large table is in the center of the room, with thirty
chairs around it. Foot high golden letters across one wall read 'FREEDOM DEFINED
IS FREEDOM DENIED'. The green smoke has made you very curious about this place,
and you think you understand the meaning of the words. You don't, though, for
you have never been free. Perhaps the owners of this place will teach you.

A Shrine to The Goddess~
This room is a shrine to a goddess. By looking around the room, you can't tell
exactly what kind of goddess she is, though. There is a sacred feel about the
room, or maybe it's just the blasted green smoke. An altar is here, and a golden
apple is smoldering on it. The smoke is apparently coming from there.

A Peaceful Sanctum~
In the center of this room, painted onto the floor is a large white peace sign.
The walls are lined with cabinets containing valuable weapons and armors. From
here you can walk west into the shrine, or south into a room that appears to be
the site of a party.

The Rumpus Room~
Apparently the crew that runs this place takes nothing seriously. The green
smoke you noticed upstairs is now almost impossibly thick down here. You'd be
coughing and choking right now, if you hadn't started to like the way it's
making you feel. Bunks and couches are strewn everywhere, and half-naked men
stroke half-naked women to ecstasy on all of them, except of course the ones
where the half-naked women are stroking the half-naked men. Some of them are
singing, and all of them seem happy.

The Ground floor of a Tall Tower~
You stand just inside an enormous granite tower. A flight of spiral stairs
leads upward to the next floor, passing through two glowing spheres of 
magickal light. Tapestries adorn the walls, showing a powerful-looking
mage pitted against a variety of creatures, many the likes of which you
have never encountered.

The Second Floor of a Tall Tower~
The great spiral staircase takes up most of this room, leading down to the 
ground floor and up further into the tower. A flowering garden of assorted
herbs and perennials surrounds the flowing fountain that takes up the
center of the room.

The Treasure Room~
This room is adorned with gold; from the etched gold-leaf that plates the
floor to the solid gold pillars that support the floor above, the sight 
takes your breath away. The spiral staircase that winds from below continues
upward here, the cold grey stone blending harshly with the glittering excess
before your eyes.

The Top of a Tall Tower~
Windows on all four walls are made of a maickal glass; perfectly
transparent and yet strong as rock.  The view of the countryside out
them is quite breath-taking; from the mountains to the north to the
smale desolate-looking village to the west.  Runes of power are 
inscribed into the ceiling here, and a small pentagram has been
etched into the floor.

At the Base of a Tall Tower~
Above you rises a tall tower of cold granite. The entrance to the north is a
large ironwood door, easily large enough to pass a wagon through.

Outside of the Pyramid~
   You stand just outside of a squat, golden pyramid that has been nestled
precariously in the cliffs on the Grey Mountains.  The entire structure can't
be more than twelve feet high and twice as wide, but just looking at the
perfectly formed structure tells you that looks can no doubt be deceiving.
You may enter the pyramid by passing through an arched doorway to your north
which is surrounded by mystic symbols the likes of which you have never
seen.
