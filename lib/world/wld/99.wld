At the Gates of Hell~
   You are standing at a set of massive iron gates.  The gates lie open,
almost inviting you inside, tempting your dark curioisities of what Hell
really is.
   As you peer east, through the gates, a wave of rancid, foul air wafts
over you, carrying the faint sound of tortured screams and wicked, evil
laughter.  A sense of dread overcomes you as you stare into the gates of
Hell itself.

the slalactites on the cave ceiling far overhead.
   Almost unnoticed, a dark shapes flits past you, and you shiver as you
realize the shadow grazed you with a touch of death.

Wandering through Hell~
   The oppressive stench and the foul occupants of this infernal realm
reinforce your initial impression of this place with every step. This
is not a place in which you belong. 
   Manes - the damned souls of the once-living - pull chains and carts
across the floor here as though they were mining the brimstone of the
walls of Hell itself.
   Hell continues to the east and south.

A Junction in the Caverns of Hell~

your skin through the gaps in your armor and bringing blood where you brush
against them.  
   The screams that have echoed since your arrival here are louder in this
part of Hell and set your nerves on edge.  Ethereal shapes flit out of the
corners of your eyes, teasing you as to whether or not you really saw them
in the shadows.
   Paths open up to the north, east, and west.

pits, driving them to scream in terror and agony as the vanish into

   But your holy place shall be untouched throughout the centuries: though
with fire and sword it be burnt down & shattered, yet an invisible house there
standeth, and shall stand until the fall of the Great Equinox; when Hrumachis
shall arise and the double-wanded one assume my throne and place. Another
prophet shall arise, and bring fresh fever from the skies; another woman shall
awake the lust & worship of the Snake; another soul of God and beast shall
mingle in the globed priest; another sacrifice shall stain the tomb; another
king shall reign; and blessing no longer be poured To the Hawk-headed mystical
Lord!

   I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men. 
Curse them! Curse them! Curse them! With my Hawk's head I peck at the eyes of
Jesus as he hangs upon the cross. I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed &
blind him. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist,
Mongol and Din. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds. Let Mary
inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly
despised among you! Also for beauty's sake and love's! Despise also all
cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight, but play; all fools despise!
But the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are brothers! As
brothers fight ye! There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.
   As you recall your classical teachings about Hell, you consider what
lies at either end of the tunnel. Could an archdemon or devil lurk there?
   The Hellish tunnel continues to the east and west.

whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at
all. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie.
Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that
any God shall deny thee for this. I am alone: there is no God where I am. 
   The visions of what you have read of Hell pass as you stroll down this
searing tunnel that leads both east and west.

The Room Of Gluttony~
   Filled with buzzing flies, this chamber's floor is littered with rotten
meats, fruits, and vegetables. An ironwood table takes up the center of the
room, and piled onto it in a great heap rots more of the same foods.
   Narrow tunnels lead into darkness to the east and west.

A Narrow Tunnel~
   To the east this narrow tunnel opens up into a vast cavern, and to the west
it seems to widen slightly. The sharp tunnel walls tear at your flesh and
clothes, and under your feet the ground is covered in a fine layer of black
dust. From the east bugs the size of your thumb scurry in like a black wave.

The Room Of Envy~
   The room is strangely empty, until you inspect more closely.  In the
southern wall you notice a hole bored into it.  Beside it, you notice
a thin, though passable crevasse beneath some crude writings in Common.

The Room Of Lust~
   Harsh screams ring in your ears as you behold the scene before you.
The walls are decorated with people - mostly male humans - dressed in
straps of leather and bound by chains.  Blood coats the walls, and its
source is obviously the barbed silver hooks that hold the poor souls to
the wall.  They scream in both agony and ecstacy for at the foot of each
living corpse stands a demonic imp, performing oral feats on the tortured
victim with a mouth full of sharp teeth.
   All this is secondary however, to the black altar in the center of the
room.  A male and female demon stand there, naked but with exaggerated
genitalia (and breasts in the female's case).  As you watch, a mortal is
pulled from the wall and thrown onto the altar.
   With piercing shrieks, the demons set in, abusing his every orifice
with their teeth, nails, ripping horns, and over-sized penises that shoot
from their bodies like stilettos.
   As the mortal is torn to shreds, the scene vanishes, leaving you in
darkness.

A Forest Road~
   You are strolling along a forest road that runs to the north and south.
Birds and unseen, rustling forest creatures scurry about the forest floor
to the east and west, disturbing the serenity of the pine forest.
   Fallen logs and mossy rocks seem to have been intentionally piled along
the side of the road to the east and west and prevent passage in those
directions.
