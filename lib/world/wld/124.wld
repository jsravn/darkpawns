On the Ocean~
   You are floating above the restless surface of the water.  As 
you venture across the water's surface, you note your shadow 
below, distorting with the currents.  Gales rush past you, hitting 
you with spray and bits of seamoss.

On the Ocean~
   You are floating without direction on the surface of the water. 
You marvel at the schools of mackerel that streak through the ocean
as though they were birds sailing in the air.  In the distance, you
can see the foam of broken ocean currents.

Coastal Waters~
   You are floating above the churning surface of the water where
it meets the coast to the far north and east.  To the south and
west the coast stretches toward the horizon.

you float above the surface, eddies crash into you, forcing you to 
pay attention to the water's motion.  In the distance, you can see 
the foam of a broken water waves.

On the Ocean~
   You are floating above the restless surface of the ocean.  You 
marvel at the schools of trout that streak through the ocean as 
though they were birds coating in the air.  The piece of driftwood 
seems to be rotted with wind.

On the Ocean~
   The wide ocean spans across your sight, making you lose all 
sense of direction.  You marvel at the schools of mackereal that 
streak through the sea as though they were birds sailing in the 
air.  The buoy seems to be rotted with brine.

On the Ocean~
   Here, otters and terns skim, splashing dutifully into the 
water.  As you float above the surface, eddies crash into you, 
forcing you to pay attention to the water's motion.  Gales rush 
past you, hitting you with wavecrests and bits of seaweed.
