see creatures as they are in the wild. The room opens up to the north where
there is a lot of commotion going on.

Malchor's Monkey World~
This room looks like a tornado has gone through it, a tree has been knocked
over to allow more things for the monkeys to climb on, branches are strewn
about the floor, and piles of feces are cumulating in the corners.

Lyratha's House of Lizards~
This room is very creepy, the magically created light is dimmed to simulate
nighttime, and vines hang down from the ceiling. The floor is covered with
leaves and sprinkled with dirt. A few hollowed out logs make room for the
inhabitants of the room to sleep and play around in.

Blazidon's Badger Paradise~
The ground here is dirt, with mounds piled up where the badgers have dug their
burrows. A tree with long, curling roots gives them places to hide in the
shade of their artificial sun.

covers the ground, and some tall, leafless trees litter the landscape. In the

Regnet's Rhino Emporium~
The ground in this room is dusty, but you can see some lush greenery growing
near a large pool of clear water. The artificial sun beats down upon you
mercilessly, the creator of this place must have been very skilled, and you
contemplate standing under one of the few trees scattered about.
