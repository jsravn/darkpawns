Labyrinth Passageway~
You are in a dark, twisty little passageway in a maze designed to confuse
and frustrate the impatient adventurer.  The walls here are made of highly
polished black ebonstone but they seem to absorb the light in this area
rather than reflect it.  From here a long passageway leads off to the south
and another little hallway branches to the east.

Near Total Darkness~
It is extremely dark here; you can just barely see the items in your
inventory.  The walls of black ebonstone seem to be absorbing nearly all
the light in this room.  Carefully, you feel around searching for exits.
There seems to be a passage leading south from here, another seems to lead
westward, and there is yet a third opening in the eastern wall.  As you stand
here, trying to choose your path, you catch a faint, putrid smell coming from
the east.

Buried Alive?!~
The world spins and you slowly lose consciousness.  When you awake you find
yourself trapped in a very small, very dark area -- your light does little
to illuminate your cell as the stone that imprison you devour the light
As you feel around you realize, to your horror, that there are no exits
from this claustrophobic little nightmare.  There is no use in screaming
but you do it anyway, until the air runs out in the room, that is.

Falling...~
You nimbly slide over the lip of the pit and begin to scale down the smooth
sides.  After about two minutes you realize it was a big mistake -- the
sides of the pit are very hot and offer very little to grab onto.  Ouch,
you lose your grip and plummet towards the bottom, miles below.  Mercifully
you pass out before your body is shattered on sharp rocks and consumed by the
fires of the underworld.

This vast room is some kind of furnace.  A large, deep pit has been drilled
deep into the ground; indeed, it is so deep that the bottom is lost in
shadow.  Waves of superhot air rush up from the underworld and into this
room -- it is so hot here that your skin is beginning to sting.  At the
top of the chamber there are large conduits which, presumably, bring the
hot air up to the top levels of the tower.  While you could certainly
climb down the pit, it looks difficult and very unsafe; the sides are very hot
and smooth.  A small passageway leads east.

torchlight reflects off them brilliantly.  The floor is made of hard, rough
stone.  You can continue both north and east from this point.
You sense an evil presence watching you from afar.

Northern End of Entry Hall~
This is a large, ornate hallway with highly polished walls of fine, black
ebonstone and a high, vaulted ceiling.  A deep-red carpet leads south, to
the other end of this large room, and matching tapestries of the finest silk
hang here on the blackened walls.  Three crystal doors are set into the
walls here; a beautiful door of crimson crystal lies to the north, a large
door of ebony crystal is set in the western wall, and a glowing door of
white, gleaming crystal hangs on the eastern wall.  The hall continues to

The marks on the crystal surface of the doors were clearly done by a

and depict a creation scene; those on the black gate are a prayer to the
Fire Lord and depict a scene in hell; Upon the red gate are pictures of all
the great heroes of old.

The Portal Room~
You are in a large, spartan room with a very high ceiling and walls of fine
ebonstone.  To the south there is a flickering, glowing portal which will
surely magically teleport you somewhere else.  To the north an ebon archway

like flowers and the room has grown a great deal brighter.  The world

The Northern Dining Room~
This is a truly wonderful room -- the crystal tables and chairs are very
nice but the view is what makes this room special.  The entire eastern wall
has been turned transparent, and the view is remarkable.  Although you can
see leaves blown by a strong wind, the air here is still and warm.  The
dining area extends to the south and a small door leads north into an

them yet.  Beyond that is the great northern wasteland, a void not yet

The bed is large and well built, its blackened wood has been skillfully

a track from which fine curtains of black suede hang.  On the wooden
headboard is a carving which tells the story of the fall of the Great
Empire.
~

The headboard carving tells of foolish kings and nobles who became so
greedy that the peasants rebelled against them.  Alone, the commoners
would have been no match for the Imperial Knights but the gods pitied
the brave serfs and caused great heroes to join the battle on their side.
When the war had ended, the Great Empire was no more and the Last Outpost
was founded by the wise gods.  Since then, many great adventurers have
come to these lands seeking fame, power and fortune.

of pure dark magic.  It shows a man in a blowing dark cloak granting the
energy of life to a creature crafted of stone and clay.  Overhead, the gods
look on in disapproval; not only is it distressing that a mere mortal has
mastered the secrets of creation, but the vain mage has made a mockery of
the gods by forming evil, wicked creatures in their sacred images.  Storm
clouds gather and foreshadow coming doom.

streaking towards his foe.  The other mage, clad in a pure white robe,
holds his hands before him, as if trying to shield himself from the
impending blast.  All about the ground are corpses of other magicians,
all clad in white.  The work is entitled "The Fall of the White Order".

mages use to activate the enchantment on this room so you doubt if they

The runes set in the walls and covered with gold are old and difficult to

and the magic-user from creatures of great power summoned here from both

of the many runes and as to the way to activate their powerful magic, so
you highly doubt if they would protect you from any creatures you might
summon.

This room is a cozy, private study which probably belongs to the Apprentice

candles around the room light up as you walk in the door and illuminate the
impressive collection of spellbooks stored neatly on the shelves here.  On

The mural is a true masterpiece.  It is painted in the long forgotten style
of the ancient masters and depicts a young man clad in the traditional robes
of an apprentice mage walking through hell towards the lair of the Fire
Lord.  His eyes are closed in deep concentration and his fists are clenched
in fierce determination.  High above, the gods look on, keenly interested.
Far away, a much older mage watches through a magical looking glass as in
the darkness the Fire Lord has sensed the intruder and prepares to roast the
foolish young mage.  The work is entitled "The Testing of the Dark Mage:
his Assention to Membership in the Black Order".

an Archmage, standing in a dark room with his eyes closed and his hands
raised above his head.  Before him, in the shadows, a mighty demi-god bows
before the mage with a look of considerable frustration and anger on his
hideous face.  The mage has, apparently given the beast a difficult and
dangerous task to perform.  In the heavens above, the gods have convened
in a Great Counsel and are discussing something heatedly.  Outside, a great
battle rages.  The painting is entitled, "The Dark Mage's Quest for Supreme
Power: The Attempted Assassination of a Deity."

This is a comfortable room with a large window set in the eastern wall which
commands a breathtaking view of the lands.  An elegant couch is sits here
and a warm fire burns in the fireplace.  A large painting has been framed
and hung on the southern wall.  The only exit is to the west.

painting~
The painting is not quite as old as some of the others in this area and is
not as skillfully crafted.  It shows the gods smiting the dark mage and
causing his evil creations to turn against each other and their creator.
A group of powerful Dopsodods are locked in battle with each other as dark
spirits and hideous creatures born of magic join the fray.  The Dark Mage
looks on in frustration and rage and plots his vengeance against the gods.
Far in the distance is the opening of a deep cave and the mage watches it
now with a strange gleam in his eye.  The painting is called "The Humbling
of the Dark Mage"

Portal Room~
You are standing in a portal room; the only non-magical exit is to the
north.  On the other walls great magical portals shimmer like brilliant
waterfalls of pure energy.  Where the portals lead, you cannot tell.

are caked onto the hard stone floor.  Apparently this is where the Dark Mage
has been trying to breed his army of evil minions.  There is an opening on the
southern wall and another leads to the east.

biological waste.  A strange, stone statue is set in the middle of the hall
and is surrounded by worthless gifts and offerings.  Apparently the creatures
who live in this area revere the ugly image as a god.  The hallway continues
to the west and east; there are doors on the northern and southern walls.

Intersection~
You are at the intersection of two hallways; the one which continues north

putrid, dirty and foul.  A large altar has been erected here, it is covered
with the images of the deities of the Thralls.  Although you doubt that these
Thrall gods have much power, you do feel safe and peaceful here.  You may
continue in any direction.

of this area they have built a large, ugly statue of stone.  It is poorly
crafted and worthless, but they seem to revere it as a god -- for there are
offerings and tributes lying at its feet.  Exits lead in every direction but

the rocky shore.  The only exit is back to the west.

shelves lining the walls of this cozy room.  A worn, leather chair sits
next to an equally worn, matching sofa.  A magical ball of light flickers
to life as you enter the room.  Through a small opening in the western
wall you can crawl out onto some kind of perch, another exit leads to the

beside you -- neat!  Exits lead in every direction.

A White Square~
You are on a some kind of a large game board.  There is either no ceiling or
it is simply so high overhead that it is obscured by darkness.  The squares
are about ten square feet in size, the white ones made of fine white marble,
the black ones made of polished ebonstone.  You note that between the squares
there is a fine, thin line of gold embedded in the huge board.  You seem to
be at the edge of the board; I hope you aren't a Knight.  Squares lie to the
north, south and west of here.

board into the great nothingness beyond -- Don't fall off!  White squares lie
to the north, south and east.

it is simply so high overhead that it is obscured by darkness.  The squares
are about ten square feet in size, the white ones made of fine white marble,
the black ones made of polished ebonstone.  You note that between the squares
there is a fine, thin line of gold embedded in the huge board.

very edge of this huge, strange board... it ends abruptly to the south with
a steep drop into darkness -- don't look down!  You may go north, west or
east.

You may go any direction but south.

are to the north and west, and there is nothing to the east but a sheep drop
off.
