Mad King's Secret Study~
You are in a small stone chamber.  The walls are bare granite blocks, 
and the ceiling is lost in the inky blackness above.  In the middle of
the room a large book rests under a sheet of glass in a small display
case.

book display case~
The book is opened to a page which reads:
   "The Mad King Seilon was obsessed with the thought that burglars
were after his treasures, so he designed his small keep to lure
unsuspecting would-be theives to an untimely death.  There was,
however, a method of reaching the treasure room, known only to King
Seilon himself.  That secret is now lost as no one knows what became 
of the poor king who sadly disappeared many years ago."

Tower Balcony~
You stand on a balcony high above the rest of the keep.  A railing has
been set up to keep idiots from falling over the edge, but it in no 
way detracts from the amazing view.  It's a little spooky when you 
look down, however.

The End of the Road~
The road ends here, turning into nothing more than a winding footpath that
leads up a hill northward to a deserted-looking keep. Clouds dot the sky 
behind it's turrets, and a lone bird wheels in the air, making this place
seem like the end of civilization.

On a narrow trail~
To the east the Great Western Road ends, but it seems someone, or something,
has succeeded in making a thin trail that extends off of it into the forest
to the west. The trail is narrow and bordered on both sides by a thick thorny
brush.

On a narrow trail~
    To your west, the forest takes on a dark and sinister look,
that must be the begining of the Dark Forest, called Noirwood by the local
inhabitants.  A small trail leads into this evil looking forest to the
west.

On a narrow trail~
The trees here are tall, reaching up far above you and forming a canopy. Some
thorn bushes line the sides of the trail, dissuading you from going north or
south. The trail, however goes east and west unimpaired.
