The Overseer's Chamber~
This is where Nevyn watches the events that happen in the Grey Keep. It is a
large room, with a bed, a bookshelf, a desk, a couple chairs, and a decorative
shield hanging on the wall with the sigil of Gil-Glash upon it.

Before a Great Wall~
Looming before you is a tall wall made out of some dark mineral which you
cannot identify. The wall is somehow melded into the mountain to the west of
you, making it more solid and giving more protection in case what the wall is
guarding is ever under siege.

Before a Massive Gate~
Standing before you is the biggest gate you've ever seen, wide enough to let
three wagons through side by side and tall enough for the tallest of giants to
walk through while holding his head high.  Unfortunately, the gates appear to
be made of the same solid stone as the mountains which surround them, and you
can see no way of opening them.

Inside the Wall~
This side of the wall faces a huge castle that spans the whole width of the
valley and is probably wider and deeper than you can imagine. The side of the
mountain to the west has been worked smooth and radiates a strong aura of
protection magicks. High green grass grows here, strangly, without weeds.

Inside the Gate~
This side of the huge gate to your south faces what looks like the front of
a remarkably giant castle made out of grey stone.  The gate itself is made
of solid stone and looks unopenable.  You are presently standing on a grassy
patch of land that appears to rim the castle wall to the east and west.

Before the Castle~
The castle wall before you is made up of a strange grey material, which gives
it an oddly forbidding appearance. Thin arrow slits line the wall to the north
and the side of the mountain to the west has been worked smooth. As you look
up you are amazed at how tall the castle is, although it is not nearly as tall
as the wall slightly to your south. Green, knee-high grass rubs against you
as you move around.

in black iron. The walls to the east and west of the doors are lined with thin
arrow slits in case of attackers. The grass here is a bright green and is not
worn down much, this place must not get many visitors.

small and not as green as the rest of the field.

As you walk into the foyer of the huge castle, balls of light that have been
inset into the east and west walls light up, dispersing all shadows from the
room. The room is unfurnished and a tall, thin door is on the east wall. To
the north is a great hall and to the south is a set of thick, wooden double

An enormous room opens before you, stretching well over a hundred feet to the
other end. The ceiling is higher than all but the tallest trees. The walls and
ceiling are layered in hammered gold, finely filigreed and delicately painted.
Rich silk tapestries hang from the walls. The far end of the room appears to be
one huge, red velvet curtain. Centered against the backdrop of the curtain is
a monolithic throne. The chair itself sits atop a raised, stepped stage as tall
as a man. The throne itself is sized to seat a giant, not a man. It is worked
in silver and inlaid with sapphires and emeralds.

Nimos didn't need much room, so unlike some of Gil-Glash's other generals, he
only asked for one small chamber without servants. The room is more like a
cluttered attic than the abode of a powerful warlock. All sorts of books and
scrolls litter the floor of the room, even the bed is partially covered with
papers. Shelves, bolted into the stone walls, line every wall but the north
one, which is dominated by a massive stone bookshelf which happens to be the
most organized part of the room. A large mirror stands in the south-east
corner, reflecting everything in the room at you.

This stone room is barren of all furniture, except for a long, wooden table
with several chips taken out of it and blood stains all over. This is where the
alhoon Alhazred interrogates prisoners and spies. Shackles hang every five feet
on the walls, and, judging from the dried blood that drenches the walls, they
were used quite recently.

Alhazred's Private Chamber~
This is where the alhoon rests and thinks up plans for the future. A very
comfortable-looking bed is in the south-west side of the room, opposite a
stainless steel tub in the south-east side, it seems to be filled with a thick,
pink liquid. Burnt into the stone floor is a large, circle covered with all
sorts of arcane letters and runes. Next to the door is a big, stone bookshelf.

The Anteroom~
This is the entryway to Raithir's rooms, it is draped in black and dark crimson
tapestries and there are comfortable looking benches against the north and
south walls. Small ceramic pots with different types of mushrooms growing from
them are in the four corners of the room. From here you can go through either
the door to the east and back to the hallway, or the door to the west and into
the rest of Raithir's chambers.

others who call the Grey Keep home. There is a huge, black marble desk that is
covered in all sorts of documents that look important. The only light in this
room comes from the glowing fungi that dot the walls. There are doors on the
east, south and north walls.

his travels, and it is truly a magnificent sight to behold. Large mounds of
gold, silver, and foreign coins are scattered around the floor. Wands, staves
and other items occasionally protrude from the piles.
