The Avenue of the Gods~
  You stand on the broad Avenue of the Gods in the city of Kir Drax'in.  To
your north is the corner of the grand stadium of Kir Drax'in.  The Avenue forms
a junction with the city wall road immediately to your west.  To your south,
there is an ivy-covered marble doorway set into an otherwise dull brick wall.

Northern Wall Road~

The wall road takes a corner here, to run against the wall to the east and
south, where it disappears through a slew of buildings and shadows. The city
arena dominates this section of the city, as well as your view to the south east.

Eastern Market Street~
   This is the beginning of the eastern side of the main road that runs
through Kir Drax'in.  To the north there is a large, quaint shop that
looks busy.  A sign with the words "Records Office" embossed on it
hangs over the doorway.  To the south is a large wall made from stone
and mortar that is covered with advertisements and other paper fliers.
Market Street continues to your east, and the Market Square is just
to your west.

a plethora of vendors set up on the streets and sidewalks here, although
you notice that the bulk of the activity seems to be to the west of here,
towards the Market Square.  A large granite building to the south houses the
Kir Drax'in bank.

Eastern Gate~

where the massive defensive wall that forms the city's perimeter opens
enough to allow passage for the steady stream of people who go in and out
of the city at all hours of the day.  The bustle of the Kir Drax'in Market
begins just west of here, and to the north and south a narrow wall road
leads to other sections of the city.

ordained and controlled by the church.  The bank itself is rather typical
of church architecture, built with strong granite walls and kept tidy in
appearance.  The bank appears to be staffed mainly by old priests and young
acolytes, but you see a few women walking about, indicating that there must
be some type of secular position available here.

that remains in the broken fountain, and the ceramic tiles that must have
once been so beautiful have been ripped up from the ground and smashed by
countless vandals.  This square, just like the entire Southern District, seems
to have fallen into disrepair.

trade road that runs to the south is well maintained and profitable for
the merchants that use it.  The southern walls of the city seem strong but
well-tested - it looks as if there was a large fire outside them some time ago
and the damage was never repaired, leaving the exterior surface charred and
burnt.  The guard checkpoint here seems to be deserted, although you can
see a small garrison of guards doing customs duty on the inside of the gate.

The Street of Swords~
   The Street of Swords reaches a concourse with the wide Avenue of the Gods
just south of here.  This area of the city is home to mostly mercenaries and
their guilds, although it is also the home of the Kir Drax'in Holy Guard.
The largest temple in the city, the Temple of the Cross, is just up a flight
of white marble steps to your east.  The Street of Swords runs north from
here.

The Street of Swords~
   The crowds walking north and south along this road are mostly men and
women equipped with swords and a wide variety of other weapons.  You can
recognize the large building to the west as the guard's barracks, home
to the city guard that oversees the Church's rule of Kir Drax'in.

Psionicist Antechamber~
   As you stand in this sparsely decorated foyer, you feel your mind
probed by many unseen Psionicists, perhaps even the guildmaster herself,
who lies in the room to the west.

Psionicist Guild~
   You stand in a cold, barren room whose wooden floor creaks loudly as you
step upon it.  The lighting is very poor here, you can vaguely make out the
outlines of unknown persons lying prone on the floor around you, apparently
in supplication.  The longer you spend here, the more you feel the crackling
of powerful energies coursing through your body.

Inside the Dojo~
   Light streams in from outside and refracts off the rice-paper walls,
turning the inside of this modest dwelling bright as day.  A few sparse
decorations -- a rack of katanas here, a painted scene of battle there,
a straw broom in the corner -- are all that decorate this place. 
   A doorway to the south marks the room of the guildmaster.

The Back Room~
   This airy room is separated from the entrance to the north by only a thin
rice-paper wall. A small fire pit has been dug in the dirt floor, over which
brews a pot of herb tea.  The room is barren of any permanent fixtures, with
the exception of several elaborate scrolls hung on the walls.

E
scrolls~
The scrolls are about3 meters long and narrow, and appear to be mundane in
nature.  They are quite beautiful however, and very old.  The images drawn on
the scrolls appear to tell a story of some kind, but the cultural significance
is lost to you.

The Arena~
   This area is for those frustrated adventurers to vent their anger
against other players.  This is a smaller arena than the one in the
great town of Kir Drax'in but it is big enough to hack something (or
someone) to bits.  There is a large wall to the north and west, but
it looks like you can leave to the east or south.

Eastern Vestibule~
  This vestibule is perfectly circular, with four marble columns supporting
the arched ceiling high above your head.  The floor here is made of perfect,
veinless white marble and inlaid with obsidian rings, forming a pattern of
concentric circles on the floor.  Ornate marble arches lead north, south,
and west.

Temple Infirmary~
   This is a large room where the sick and the dying are cared for by the
nuns and priestesses of the Church.  There are about fifty straw beds arranged
in four rows here, and almost all of them are full.  Most of the patients are
either common citizens or foreigners; the military has their own infirmary
as do the large temples.  The wealthier citizens can afford an in-home visit
by a Church healer.  The entire room smells of medicinal soap.  There is
a single exit through a marble archway to the north.

Quiet Room~
   This is a quiet room, used by the priests and priestesses of the Cross
for prayer and meditation.  There is a large window in the northern wall
that looks out over the beautiful temple garden, but you can't see any way
to get to it from here.  A marble archway leads south from this room to
the eastern vestibule.
