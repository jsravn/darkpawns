The Gates of Haven~
   A set of iron gates to the south marks the entrance to the coastal town
of Haven, renowned for its trade prowess, sea-fairing population and chance
to make some quick gold. Looking to the north, you can see a dirt road
disappear into the surrounding forest. A cobblestone road begins at the gates
and extends well into the town.

A Cobblestone Road in Haven~
   The cobblestone road you are on starts at the gates to the north and
travels south, providing the main thoroughfare for Haven's mostly pedestrian
traffic. However, a number of wagons pass by, heavily laden with goods on their
way to the cities of Kir Drax'in and Alaozar. A group of fishermen stare at
you intently but say nothing.
   The sounds of laughter drift across the road from the open doors of a
double story building to the west, a small sign proclaiming it as the Drunken
Jig Inn. The Haven Customs House is on the eastern side of the road.

The Drunken Jig Inn~
   You are greeted by both the sound and smell of a number of drunk sailors
who treat this inn as a second home. Dirty tables are scattered around you
while the bar occupies the center of the room. In the darker corners, whispered
conversations continue despite the noise and merriment.
   Stairs to the west lead up to the sleeping accommodation while the main road
is to the east.

   Bloodshot eyes look up from various tables as you make your way around the
inn. A few of the more sober patrons offer you a glance before returning to
their conversations. A small scuffle breaks out near the bar but is quickly
sorted out by the inn keeper. The second floor can be accessed by stairs to the
north while you can see the exit from the inn to the north east.

inn but unfortunately the noise from the drunk patrons prevents you from
hearing what is being said. You almost trip over one of the tables as you
attempt to get closer and decide in the end it's not worth the trouble.
To the north, sailors continue to stream into the inn from the town and it
won't be long before it will be standing room only.

The Customs House~
   This small structure is sparsely furnished and serves as the Customs House
for the town. In earlier times, traders leaving to travel abroad would stop
by here to detail the goods they carried in an effort to prevent theft along
the way. However, the town is now controlled more by the pirates and merchants
who frequent the port rather than the appointed officials who govern here.
As such, the Customs House is rarely used.

   The town square is central to Haven and provides a meeting place for the
local inhabitants, as well as a social area for the many creatures that
frequent the area. Several benches on the perimeter of the square form a loose
circle around a small, wooden platform in the middle of the street. A number
of traders have set up makeshift stalls along the edge of the street, each
trying to get your attention in an effort to sell their goods.
   A signpost on the corner of the square points southward to the town docks
and east to Guild road.

collapsed on the floor below. Stairs lead to the bar down below.

Rubbish is piled high against the far wall and covers the majority of the
floor, a broken window overlooks the forest and has allowed a number of birds
to make this room their home. A filthy mattress can just be seen poking out
of the rubbish. The only exit from the room is to the south.

The Guild Road~
   Although relatively small, the town of Haven is well known for the amount
of goods that travel its roads. As such, a group of merchants long ago created
a merchant guild, a place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of sea
life and to exchange both tales and trade routes. Second only to the tavern
in size, the guild is a large building and can be entered through a door to
the south.
   A small building to the north houses the town public works officer.

homes~

   Sandy footprints from the east travel past you and head towards the town
square. Looking to the east, you cannot clearly see the source of the sand
but being a coastal town, it's only logical that there would be some around.
The guild of the merchants is to your south, although you can only enter it
through the door to the south west. A small shrine has been created in the
building to the north as a place of worship for the town's residents.

   There are similar buildings to the north and south, each with a sign
above the doorway.  The Guild Road continues in its cobblestone form to the

Merchants, a collection of traders from various ports around the world. Your
intrusion into their lives is tolerated as your explorations are well known
by the guild members.
   The guild is well furnished and contains all manner of artwork, fine
pottery and exquisite hand woven rugs, obviously collected from long voyages.
Small groups of merchants are huddled around the room deep in conversation
about the next journey to be undertaken. The Guild Road lies through the door
to the north.

numerous offerings, perhaps in an attempt to protect the town from the harsh
sea weather or more often than not, the frequent pirate attacks.

are anchored out in the bay, preferring to dock here only to unload cargo.

fishermen. The docks of Haven are to the west and east of here, or you can

   Spices, spices and even more spices. These items have been brought here
from afar in an attempt to liven up the otherwise staple diet of fish that
the majority of the citizens and visitors to Haven are treated to. The
merchant is very enthusiastic about his goods and does everything except
steal from you to get you to stay in his store. The docks of Haven are through
the doorway to the south.

The Fishmonger's Store~
   The majority of fish bought into Haven is packaged here and taken away to
be sold in other cities. Old crates have been left around the floor, filled
with those fish deemed unacceptable for sale elsewhere. You can see no sign
of refrigeration or preservation and can only assume these fish are fresh,
although judging by the odor you're not so sure. You can walk back onto
the boardwalk through the door to the south.

The Pawn Shop~
   This store is full of little trinkets and pieces of jewelry that have
been "acquired" by the merchant, most of them cheap and damaged in some
respect. Sailors wander in, most of them drunk, looking for something that
could possibly be sold elsewhere for more gold than it was purchased with.
   The sounds of the dock enter through the door to the south as another
ship arrives to offload cargo.

The Vault within the Guild~
   You can see why the guild members where uneasy as you approached the door
to this back room...it's full of loot! Unfortunately, most of it is contained
in locked chests and you wouldn't have time to grab any of it before you
were forcibly removed from here. There are a few loose items that you could
hide on your possession, however.

   It is here that sailors and pirates alike come to purchase new ships.  The
walls are covered in large parchments detailing the latest in designs and
a single desk sits in the corner of the room.  You take a moment to glance
at an open book on the desk and learn that due to an infestation in the supply
of wood, the production and sales of ships has ceased temporarily although
a number of small one-person boats are available.

Seagulls float around on unseen currents of air, enjoying the attention they
will soon be getting when old fish are thrown out to make way for new stock.
The dock continues to the south while the town's boardwalk is to your north.

   From the end of the dock, you can barely see the town even though it sits
only a few hundred feet from you. As was intended when Haven was first built,
the integration between the forest and town buildings has been accomplished
to such a degree that you would not realize it was there until you arrived
at its gates.
   Haven bay stretches out in front of you while the dock leads north back
to the town.

to the town's warehouses. Crates lined with dried seaweed cover the area,
reeking of rotten fish.
   The boardwalk lies to the north while the dock continues to the south.

port towns, and the many coves and inlets that dot the coast make it a good
base for the less savory characters of this world. From the end of the dock,
you can see a large cliff face jut out to sea to your west, providing a
barrier from the open ocean.

Walking Down the Back Streets of Haven~
   It looks as if this area of the town was merely added on in haste as the
population grew. The streets are made of uneven cobblestone that has been
forced into the clay-soil base, creating a dangerous walking surface. The
buildings lean in one direction or another, having been constructed with just
as much haste as the street.

A Gambling Den~
   You've never seen a larger group of pirates, thieves and general unlikable
characters. Of course, you can't see that well at all given the layer of smoke
that descends from the roof. The room is packed to the rim with tables,
rowdy groups of men and women playing gambling games of some sort at each.
   It would be wise to keep an eye on that coin purse of yours as it could
easily disappear as you move throughout the room. You spy a door on the
eastern wall.

   The door opens to a small back room with only a few tables, all of them
empty except to your left. There are no windows here, only the torches mounted
on the walls provide any light and even then it is minimal. You can't be
certain but it looks as if there are blood stains both on the plush carpet
and walls, perhaps an indication of how intense the gaming is in here.
   As you look around further, you realize that this room has been set aside
for those patrons who like to spend big! The table to the left is laden with
gold coins, the chairs are cushioned and the carpet feels spongy as you walk
around. The only exit is via the door to the west.

what they need and leave. With most of the trade routes long established,

   You trudge your way along a sandy path that initially heads east towards
the coast before sloping down to a small beach to the south. A cobblestone
road to the west simply begins and marks the eastern entrance to the port
town of Haven.
   At times, you are forced to cover your face as sand is whipped up by 
strong gusts of wind. The piercing shrieks of seagulls are the only sounds
you can hear above the wind.

   Waves lap softly at the shore of this small beach, only a quick walk from

Haven bay are both warm and sheltered. To the north, two large clay dunes
provide raw building materials and it is for this reason the beach exists.
Over time, enough clay has been removed to reach a layer of sand upon which
you now stand.
   To the west, you can see the port area of Haven which can be accessed by
a wooden boardwalk.

   With the activity you can see above you on the boardwalk, it's a wonder
no one has bothered to come down and enjoy a swim in Haven bay. Perhaps the
lack of fish within the bay is a result of something unknown to you that
keeps everyone out of its waters, but nothing obvious strikes you. Stairs
provide access to the boardwalk and dock area while the beach follows the
water's edge to the east.

face to the west provides a natural barrier against wind and waves...it also

Haven Bay~
   You float in probably the most sheltered area of Haven bay apart from
that between the docks. The breakwater extends from the beach to the north
and prevents travel to the east or south. Waves crash into the opposite side
to remind you that the ocean is not that far away.

Walking Down the Back Streets of Haven~
   The street abruptly ends here, becoming a narrow dirt path that winds its
way to the south and up towards the entrance to Haven bay. A lighthouse can
just be seen at the very end of the path although it doesn't appear to be
operating at this time. You have one of two choices; continue onwards to the
lighthouse or return to the streets.

A Narrow Dirt Path~
   The dirt path follows the land as it slopes upwards towards the lighthouse
and follows the western edge of Haven bay well below you. You can see now that
the town was built in a coastal inlet, this piece of land providing some
shelter from the ships anchored in the bay. Further south, if you should stray
from the path, you will fall down one of the cliff faces to the east and
west.

A Narrow Dirt Path~
   The path takes a quick turn to the west and ends at the foot of an
abandoned lighthouse. From this height, you have a fantastic view of the
ocean to the south and of Haven bay and the town itself to the east. People
scurry about on the docks and if weren't for the color of the roof tops, you
may not even have noticed the town was there. It blends in almost perfectly
with the surrounding forest which perhaps was the intention when Haven was
first built.

At the Foot of an Abandoned Lighthouse~
   It has been many years since this lighthouse saw action, judging by the
condition of the building and the fact that the door before you is boarded
up to prevent people from entering. The lighthouse probably saved many a ship
from crashing into the rocks and would have prevented countless deaths. You're
not sure why it's no longer used, but the ships continue to sail to this port
without hitting trouble.
   The dirt path leads back down to the town.

A Gambling Den~
   The smoke is less dense in this area of the establishment, due to some
unknown source of air circulation. You observe a few games of cards and it
becomes apparent that everyone is cheating, from the players to the dealers
themselves. For your own safety, perhaps you shouldn't involve yourself,
especially given the daggers you can see that people have tried to conceal.

You're not even sure they are dealers...perhaps they're just players on the
other side of the table?

A Gambling Den~
   You have to push and shove your way past a wall of creatures just to see
what all of the commotion is about in this part of the den. A small fenced
arena has been set up in the center of the room, two reptile-like fighters
battling it out to the amusement of the assembled crowd.

There are too many varieties to count...kenderkin, humans, dwarves, elves,
minotaurs...perhaps you should just watch the battle.

A Gambling Den~
   You wander around the casino amidst a mass of frenzied people shouting
at each other in a myriad of different tongues. In this corner of the room
there are several craps tables set up, all of them surrounded by eager
patrons gambling their money away. You can't help but keep checking for your
coin purse every few minutes or so, thinking that it may have gone missing
with all these seedy characters around you. Maybe you are too paranoid...maybe
not.

craps~
You've seen this game before, you think.  It involves a wooden table, 
some bone dice, and several numbers etched on the surface of the table
in a grid.  You watch for a little while but the pace of the game is
too fast for you to figure out exactly what is going on.

On the Ocean~
   You are floating above the churning surface of the water. As you try
to swim around, eddies crash into you forcing you to pay closer attention
to the water's motion. You are now completely disoriented although you can
see a large cliff face nearby and what looks like a small cave.

Haven Bay~
   You swim around in the pleasant waters of the bay, the open ocean directly
to the south and west. A dock juts out into the bay and you could probably
climb onto it if you traveled to the north or east.
