The Entrance To Paphoset's Temple~
   A pair of matched, semicircular projections, each about 50 feet high and
pierced by long, thin windows provides entry to the structure. Sand enters the
chamber through the base of these windows, spilling into the foyer like a vast
waterfall.

The Foyer Of The Temple Of Paphoset~
   The vast width of this chamber is difficult to determine, even in daylight,
and the shadowy reaches of the far walls are not revealed by torches. The
air is thick with dust, making breathing difficult.
   A massive stone head can be seen below against the opposite wall of the
chamber, partially covered by sand. Most features of the grim countenance are
worn away, but the figure still reflects great power, and the enormous
statue is and awe-inspiring creation, indicative of the advancement of the
culture that created it.

The Atrium~
   The most prominent feature of this cavernous chamber is the set of eight
huge columns, the bases of which are statues of kneeling gods, and wonders
of design and craftmanship. Climbing to twenty feet in height, each base
features a figure with a beastly head atop a human body, with hieroglyphics
identifying the figure. A set of stairs leads down.

The Trophy Room~
   The contents of this room are a testament to the peak of Paphoset's power
before his descent into madness. Lining the walls are spears, shields and
other spoils of battle, all of unusual, antiquated design. The heraldry
and weapon-craft of dozens of long-dead cultures are preserved here. A set
of stairs leads up.

Archives~
   This chamber was designed to house books, scrolls, and artwork glorifying
Paphoset, and to preserve detailed records of his words and deeds as a god.
Obviously, this room was not used for long, for Paphoset never reached his 
goal of divine ascension. All books glorifying the king at the expense of Set
and other gods were destroyed long ago. The room is now barren.

cataclysm, and was the first to be completed. Continuous prayers to Paphoset
were once uttered here by his priests. Ruins of a marble altar line the west
wall.

Corridor~
   This ten foot wide hallway is filled with dust, cobwebs, and crumbled rock,
appearing to have been unused for many years. The walls feature faded,
cracked paintings of Paphoset's great achievements, portrayed in both literal
and symbolic fashion. While the specifics of these scenes are not discernible,
a common theme seems to be powerful beings of varied types paying homage to
a human king.

The Shrine~
   In the center of this semicircular, domed chamber stands an empty, 8'-high
pedestal. Atop the pedestal is a circular depression designed to hold the
base of a statue. Paphoset intended his likeness to be placed here, where
statues of the divinities, like vassals, would bow their heads in homage,
there is a message carved on the front of the pedestal.

Paphoset's Sanctuary~
   This lavish, columned room was built to accommodate great lethargy, for the
most distinctive features are a plush divan and many soft, silken cushions,
all set on a large, raised platform at the far end of the chamber. This
luxury is in stark contrast to the room's repulsive inhabitant.

Entry Chamber~
   This room is designed as the entry into the crypt. It is made of marble
and has faded paintings, depicting some of Lothar's lesser deeds, along the
walls. Two marble benches, one along each wall, are here, to allow those
who would come and pay their respects to Lothar the chance to rest and
compose themselves before they continue.

The Grand Hall~
   This room is decked out as a great banquet hall, a place for Lothar and his
noble companions to have great feasts in the afterlife. There is a long
table in the center of the room with twelve stout, wooden chairs. The table
and the chairs are all lavishly decorated with carvings of wild game. The 
walls contain displays of weapons and shields. The displays are old and
rusting, and it is obvious that there is nothing of any value there.

mystery. The kitchen contains a fireplace, storage cabinets, pots and pans-

The Ballroom~
   Apparently, whoever designed this crypt thought that dead men entertained,
because this room is set up as a nice ballroom. Giant candle chandeliers 
dangle from the ceiling. The candles are unlit but the candle holders 
glow with an unearthly, dark light. There are no furnishings in this room
but the walls are decorated with more faded paintings, showing more of
Lothar's brave deeds.

   You suddenly find yourself in a brightly lit room surrounded by hundreds of
people. You feel dizzy and disoriented. As your eyes adjust to the brightness,
you realize that you are actually in a room filled with mirrors and the other
figures you thought you saw are only reflections.

eyes adjust to the dim and mistly light radiating from the walls, you see a
very large room. Your attempts to orient yourself to your surroundings are cut
short by the sight of movement a far corner.

A Narrow Space Between Mountains~
You are on a thin trail that lies between two mountains. If attacked here, the
space would be hard to defend, but you feel safe here, and for some reason
believe that the danger is all ahead. To the north the trail continues and to
the south lies the forest.

moving. To the south the trail continues, to the north the trail runs into
an open field.

Inside the Bell Tower~
You are in a small tower made from stone. An ancient staircase spirals down into
the darkness. The stairs are slick with algae and slime, making your footing
treacherous. You don't even want to think about what would happen were you to
fall. The walls are covered with a dark green slime and there is nothing to hold
on to. Above you is the belfry where the bells are held.

  You stand on the surface of a large flat rock which seems to be floating
in misty space.  This is the astral plane, the place in between dimensions.
The surface of this rock is covered in runes the likes of which you have never
seen before.  There seems to be no escape from this rock save stepping
off of it into astral space, a move which certainly would be permenantly
fatal.

A Secret Passage~
  Claustrophobia is begining to set in as you continue to navigate down
this narrow crawlspace.  You gasp for air, choaking on the heavy dust.
Seperated from the rest of your party by the sheer narrowness of the tunnel,
your bravery seems to dim.  Ahead to the west, you think that you can feel
cool air passing over your sweat soaked skin.  Is there an opening there,
or are you begining to hallucinate?  Darkness engulfs you, waves of paranoia
wash over you.  This could be the end.

The Inner Chambers~
  You stand in a cramped, circular apsis which is dominated by an icon
of the anicent called Serapis. The rooms size and circular construction makes
you feel as if you are trapped in a shaft of some sort.  This room, like
the atrium to your south, seems to be abnormally clean, even though it has
been left undisturbed for thousands of years. Well, almost undisturbed...

The Atrium~
  The narrow crawlspace suddenly opens up in to this dimly lit atrium. 
This room is completely circular, with walls covered in heiroglyphs carved
in bas-relief.  The ceiling here is a smooth, unadorned dome, what little
light there is appears to come from recessed sources above the lip of
the walls and is reflected faintly by the dome.  What is most disturbing
about this place is the total lack of any signs of life.  It is eeriely quiet,
and the air seems cooler than that in the rest of the temple.  In stark
contrast to the rest of the temple, this room apears to be dust-free.
To the north, there appears to be another chamber whose entrance is covered
by a tattered velvet curtain.

The dust here is as thick as sand, and small white worms writhe in it.
The walls and ceiling of this crawlspace have etchings on them that might
once have been heiroglyphs, but the erosion of the limestone walls has
left them unreadable.  The passage continues in darkness to the east and west.
