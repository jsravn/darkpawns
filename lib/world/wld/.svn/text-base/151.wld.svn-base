The Foothills of the Grey Mountains~
Dark hills, sparsely covered with stunted trees, rise out of the Plains of
dor-Sefrith, the vanguard of the forbidding Grey Mountains.  Sheer cliffs block
any possible path to the north and west, to the east are more foothills, and 
south the hills slowly blend into the plains.

The Plains~
You stand on the edge of the vast, rolling plains of dor-Sefrith. Ankle to knee 
high grass bends gently in the wind and the air is warm and humid. Looking out 
across the plains you can see for some distance. The horizon wavers hazily in 
the heat. To the north, you can see the foothills and peaks of a mountain 
range. Plains surround you to the south as far as you can see.

The Foothills Of The Grey Mountains~
   Dark hills, sparesly covered with stuned trees, rise out of the Plains of
dor-Sefrith, the vanguard of the forbidding Grey Mountains.  Sheer, vertical
cliffs block any possible path to the north and east, though there seems to
be a large castle set into the cliffs to the north. Off to the west, you
see more foothills, while to the south, the rolling hills slowly blend into
the plains.

The Coastal Plains~
You stand atop the towering sea cliffs along the southern edge of the vast
dor-Sefrith plains. The steep sand and clay cliffs plummet straight down and
are highly unstable.  Best not to get too close.  The air here is very humid
and the sounds of the beach and ocean fills your ears. Plains surround you to
the north as far as you can see. To the east the cliffs continue. To the 
south the ocean stretches out into the horizon.

The Coastal Plains~
You stand atop the towering sea cliffs along the southern edge of the vast
dor-Sefrith plains. The steep sand and clay cliffs plummet straight down and
are highly unstable.  Best not to get too close.  The air here is very humid
and the sounds of the beach and ocean fills your ears. Plains surround you to
the north as far as you can see.  The cliffs continue to the east and west. 
To the south the ocean stretches out into the horizon.

The Plains~
You stand on the edge of the vast, rolling plains of dor-Sefrith. Ankle to knee
high grass bends gently in the wind and the air is warm and humid. The air has 
a definite smell of salt and you can hear the sounds of the ocean. Looking 
out across the plains you can see for some distance. The horizon wavers hazily 
in the heat. Plains surround you as far as you can see to the north, east and 
west. To the immediate south you can now see the ocean.

The Ocean Road~
You stand on the vast, rolling plains of dor-Sefrith. Ankle to knee high grass 
bends gently in the wind and the air is warm and humid. The air has a definite
smell of salt now, but you cannot see the source yet. Looking out across the 
plains you can see for some distance. The horizon wavers hazily in the heat. 
To the distance in the north you can see the peaks of a mountain range. Plains 
surround you as far as you can see. The road turns south and continues east.

The Coastal Plains~
The plains have given way to a wide sandy beach. It lies on the shores of
a protected bay off the ocean. The cry of gulls fills your ears and the smells
of the ocean fill your senses. There is some seaweed on the beach. To the
west the plains stretch endlessly, north the beach continues, south is plains
as the beach curves outward, and east is the bay.

You stand on the vast, rolling plains of dor-Sefrith. Ankle to knee high grass 
bends gently in the wind and the air is warm and humid. The air has a definite
smell of salt now, but you cannot see the source yet. Looking out across the 
plains you can see for some distance. The horizon wavers hazily in the heat. 
Plains surround you as far as you can see. To the southeast the plains lead to
the city of Kir Oshi. The road continues north and south.

The Coastal Plains~
You stand atop the towering sea cliffs along the southern edge of the vast
dor-Sefrith plains. The steep sand and clay cliffs plummet straight down and
are highly unstable.  Best not to get too close. The air here is very humid 
and the sounds of the beach and ocean fills your ears. The land begins to slope
gently downwards toward the east, the cliffs diminishing into steep slopes
with loose sand. Plains surround you to the north as far as you can see. To the
west and south the ocean stretches out into the horizon.
