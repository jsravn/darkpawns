The Entrance to the Lighthouse~
   You are confronted by a medium sized room that appears to have been some
type of living area at one time. Pieces of broken furniture are scattered
around you, covered in faded white sheets in an attempt to protect them from
the layer of dust that now sits on the floor. Footprints leads from the door
to the east across the room to the west and into what looks like a hallway.
   The floorboards creek under your weight which is a worrying thought as the
lighthouse sits a good 80 feet above Haven bay and you are unsure as to the
integrity of the foundation. A flash of movement catches your eye but before
you realise what it was, it is gone. The room continues to the north, west
and south or you can walk back down the path to the east to Haven.

In the Keeper's House~
   This living area was actually the lower level of the lighthouse keeper's
residence and has been left to deteriorate without a full-time replacement.
Light filters in through the entrance to the south, the windows in this room
were long ago bricked up to keep the place from being looted. Square sections
on the walls mark the location of pictures that once hung here, perhaps in
an effort to liven the place up; it could certainly use it now as a feeling
of discomfort descends upon you.

   A small fireplace occupies this corner, half-burnt logs still sitting on
a metal frame within it. Outside, you can hear the sound of the wind which
howls around the lighthouse and this attached home, obviously highlighting
the need for the fireplace during the colder days and nights. Debris falls
from the roof, almost striking you before landing on the floor. Looking up,
you can see the support beams for the roof are in a terrible condition, quite
a few of them cracked and split.
   To the south, you can see a hallway that leads away from this main room.

In the Keeper's House~
   A narrow hallway to your west connects the main living area of the house
to the kitchen. Your footprints now join those which begin at the entrance
to the east and continue past you into the hallway. A single portrait has
been left within the room and hangs just to the left of the hallway entrance,
it's eyes following your every move...or so you think anyway.
   You're having trouble breathing in this area of the house, partly due to
the dusty environment and the very stale air. All sorts of fungii have
grown on the floor and walls, thriving in the moisture rich sea air.

In the Keeper's House~
   You almost trip over a few chunks of wood that once upon a time were a
chair. This area of the room appears to have been where food was served as is
evident by the round table that sits before you, remarkably still in one
piece although the damp sea air has slowly eaten it away over time. Chairs
covered with more sheets have been evenly placed around the table, scraps
of food still sitting on it.
   A small study adjoins the living area to teh south but before you can look
further, what feels like a hand rests on your shoulder causing you to spin
around wildly, only to find nothing there.

In the Keeper's House~
   Cool air circulates around you from a source that you cannot locate. It is
unusual, however, that the breeze doesn't disturb the layer of dust at your
feet nor does it move the moth-eaten curtains attached to the walls where
the windows once were. Moisture clings to your body and you can almost see
the floorboards and walls being eaten away by the mildew that has formed
over time.
   The entrance to the lighthouse lies to the north.

   You stand in a narrow hallway that runs the length of the house. To your
south, you can see what looks like a small cloakroam while to the north, you
can access the lighthouse kitchen. The footprints from the east travel past
you and up the rickety stairs nearby.
   The remains of carpet line the hallway but the proximity to the sea has
left little to cover the floor. Cobwebs swing freely from almost every
corner you can see but their creators are no where to be found.

The Cloakroom~
   The room is actually larger than you first thought, large enough at least
for a person to stand here. The room was used to hang clothes, most likely
heavy jackets used by the keeper on his continual journey to the top of the
lighthouse. Now, nothing remains except the metal bars that run between the
walls.
   A narrow hallway to the north provides access to other areas of the
combined lighthouse and living area.

The Lighthouse Kitchen~
   The lighthouse kitchen must have been quite grand in its day, especially
since it was only required for a family of four people. Looking around now,
all you can are rusty pots and pans as well as a number of cobwebs strung
from various parts of the rooom. Water drips from a leaky tap and creates a
hollow sound each time it strikes the bottom of one of the kitchen sinks.
   The northern wall is curved as this room formed part of the original
lighthouse, now extended by the addition of the family house. Tracks on the
wall mark where water has travelled from the rooms above down to this lower
level.

   This end of the kitchen contains two large ovens, their combined width
spanning the entire wall. Cupboards above your head hold what is left of the
crockery used by the lighthouse residents, the majority of it now in hundreds
of little pieces.
   The kitchen extends to the east where you can return to the main living
area or you can travel through the door set in the northern wall, its surface
having been clawed by an unknown creature. Although this lighthouse has been
deserted for some years, you hear an occasional groan coming from the floor
above.

The Kitchen Pantry~
   This small room adjacent to the kitchen contains a number of shelves which
at one time would have been filled with foodstuffs. It also provides access
to the cellar below where the keeper doubtlessly stored a collection of
wines and ales. Although the lighthouse is only a short walk to the town of
Haven, rumor abounds about the recluse nature of the family that lived here
and the activities that were carried out behind closed doors.

The Study~
   Why a lighthouse keeper would have need for a study, you cannot fathom,
but you stand in one now. Loose sheets of paper lie on the floor, covered in
the same layer of dust that the remainder of this house contains. You're not
certain, but what looks like blood is splattered on the far wall and on the
tattered drapes that hang over another boarded up window.
   What sounds like something being dragged on the floor is coming from the
room to the north.

a book is to be found in this old library. You assume that there probably
wasn't a lot of books here to begin with and the remainder were most likely
stolen.

while a second set to the north probably lead up to the top of the
lighthouse.
   You shiver uncontrollably for just a few brief seconds as if someone
had traced a feather up and down your back but there is no one here.

Climbing the Spiral Staircase~
   You stand at the base of a spiral staircase that undoubtedly leads to the
top of the lighthouse. There are no windows here and the torches affixed
to the wall are literally dripping water, ensuring they won't be used again.
   Glancing over your shoulder, you notice a distinct change in the wall
structure. It is here that the house was attached to the brick lighthouse
and apparently no one got around to painting the walls a common color, not
that it really matters now.

the house. Mold grows in patches on the floor, walls and ceiling. There are
also many cobwebs but these too seem to be decaying. What remains of a bed
lies to the east and a smashed mirror hangs on the north wall.
   Many years ago, this bedroom would have been occupied by the keeper and
his wife but now it lies dormant and disused.

bed frame sits near the window, strips of cloth hanging from its top. Parts

   The smaller of the two bedrooms in the house, this one was used by the
keeper's children. A few toys still sit on the floor but the remainder of the
room is empty. Cracks in the wall radiate out from a central location as if
a blunt object has been rammed into it. A window on the southern wall has,
like the others, been boarded up although gaps between the planks of wood
allow you to look across a small area of Haven bay.
   The door to the north leads to a narrow hallway and across that, the
door to the master bedroom. This room extends further to the east.

At the Top of the Lighthouse~
   The room is completely enclosed by glass, apart from the roof above you.
In the center of the floor, a large silver dish rotates slowly powered by a
mechanical device of sorts. A glowing gemstone sits in front of the dish
and provides the necessary light, however, it sits high above the floor level
and you are unable to reach it. Gaps in the roof have allowed numerous
storms to aid in the deterioration of this room, mainly the wooden floorboards
which break under your steps.
   A trapdoor set in the floor is the only safe exit from the room.

The Wine Cellar~
   Either the lighthouse keeper really loved his wine or this cellar was
used as a storage area for Haven. This area is quite large and could more
than easily handle the needs of the family living in the house above you.
   The cellar is divided into four chambers, each sub-divided into a number
of rows by the wine racks that extend from the floor to the ceiling. The walls
are made of rock since the cellar has been built into the cliff foundation
that the lighthouse sits on. Stairs lead up from here to the ground floor
of the house.

discover that the hole in the wall is merely a part of the degradation that

and you must be careful not to stand to closely or the entire section may
give way.
   A barrel over six feet tall and 3 feet wide sits against the far wall,

Wine racks travel from the northern wall to the southern wall within this
chamber and you find it difficult to move between them. Broken bottles of
wine still remain in the racks, their contents spilled long ago leaving no
trace.

The Wine Cellar~
   You step on a small clump of mushrooms that have sprouted up from the
floor. It looks as if the foundation of this cellar is not entirely rock
which is a worrying though since you now stand in it. You can access two of
the other chambers to the north and west. Large barrels sit flush against
the eastern and southern walls.

In a Large Barrel~
   Remarkable and also very clever. This barrel is something of a primitive
safe, although whoever placed it here has emptied it out. You can still smell
the wine that this barrel once contained and you begin to feel light headed
as the fumes take effect. The only exit is through the barrel opening to the
west.

   It looks as if someone has been doing work on the sub-structure here
recently. Large chunks of rock and wood lie in a heap on the ground, the
eastern wall appearing to be the source. As you move closer, several smaller
stones drop onto the floor and sound echoes throughout the wine cellar.

house and you wonder how much further this sub-structure extends. Obviously,
this area was unknown to the lighthouse keeper and his family as is apparent
by the relatively intact walls and lack of dust.
   Stairs lead up to the wine cellar and the passageway continues to the east

   The sight before you is like none you have ever seen before. If a place
of eternal torment existed, then this would most likely be it - this room
is a torture chamber and from the looks of it, has been widely and recently
used. Wooden and mechanical devices fill the floor space and still contain
bodyparts and a covering of fresh blood. What remains of one poor creature
has been stuffed into a barrel in the corner, a makeshift coffin of sorts.
   Before you exit to the west, you are overwhelmed by a sense of torment
and anguish which, in such a place, is not hard to believe. It's as if the
lives lost in here have remained, unable to escape into any form of afterlife.

both of them. Two human skulls levitate at the entrance, each emitting a
soft light that is rather inadequate for a chamber of this size. The floor
is covered by a plush carpet and the rock walls have been highly polished,
a painstaking process you imagine.
   To the east you can see what looks like an altar while to the north,
a single bookshelf and desk rest against the far wall. You can enter a dark
passageway through the door to the south.

the seal of Mistkeep, and yet others the crest of Kir Oshi. The ground is a
combination of rock and sand, showing telltale signs of pedestrian traffic.
   To the east, you can see a small opening in the cavern wall while in most
other directions, tunnels branch off into other areas.

   You stand at what could be the beginning or the end of a lengthy tunnel

rocky walls in this place leaving many interconnecting passageways, although
the majority are too small for any creature to fit into. You can, however,
access a large cavern to the south or progress further into the tunnels to
the north or west.

A Large Sea Cave~
   You have reached the end of the dock and can only progress west onto the
ship, travel east along the dock or north to enter the waters of the cave
lagoon. Looking northward, the open ocean beckons through the mouth of the
cave.

The Upper Deck~
   It's not until you are aboard this ship do you realise that the flag it
flies is that of a skull and crossbones. Judging by the relatively small
size of this ship, it has been designed for speed rather than cargo carrying
capability although by the looks of it, the ship can hold quite a few tons
of goods.

The Upper Deck~
   You skirt around a large hole in the middle of the ship which appears
to be an access point for the loading and unloading of cargo. A wooden crane
system has been erected to lift goods from the cargo hold and swing them
out onto the dock. The ship rocks gently in the waters of the lagoon but you
can only travel to the north or south along the deck.

The Sea Cave Lagoon~
   The water is quite pleasant as you swim around near the beach to the east.
A school of small fish swims nearby, not afraid of your intrusion into
their domain. The lagoon is shallow here and you can easily stand on the
bottom but it deepens rapidly to the west.
   You can climb onto a wooden dock to the south or swim further around the
lagoon to the north and west.

The Sea Cave Lagoon~
   You splash around in the shallow waters of the lagoon, a nice sandy beach
directly east of here. The cave wall blocks any travel to the north and you
can just see the ocean through the cave mouth to the west. The lagoon extends
to the south and west.

The Sea Cave Lagoon~
  You have reached the mouth of a large sea cave, the calm waters of the
cave lagoon to the south and east. To your north, the ocean waves crash
against the outside of the cave walls but surprisingly have no effect on the
waters here. Further to the east, a sandy beach hugs the eastern wall of the
cave while to the south, a wooden dock extends from the beach to a medium
sized ship.

The Sea Cave Lagoon~
   The lagoon is quite deep here which makes sense given the ship that is
docked to the west. The cave provides a fantastic hiding place and obviously
someone has used that to their advantage. You cannot climb onto the ship
from here, but you can scramble onto the dock to the south or travel further
around the lagoon to the north or east.

to avoid bumping your head on the beams. You can travel into the cargo hold
to the south or through a door to your west. Stairs lead upwards to the top
deck.

The Captain's Quarters~
   Apparently, only the captain of this vessel has any personal space at all
and even that is fairly cramped. This small room contains nothing more than
a bunk and a table in the corner. A single porthole on the western side gives
a nice view of the cave wall.

you feel drawn to the middle of the room by some magical force. It requires
great effort to move anywhere but from the position you are in.

you lose your footing as you travel along the tunnel. It bends here, continuing
up the slope to the east and also further to the south.

of light, creating an interesting shadow effect.

A Tunnel System~
   You stand at what could be the beginning or the end of a lengthy tunnel
system, depending on your point of view. Sounds echo around you, carried
through a series of smaller tunnels, the majority of which are too small for
any creature to fit into. You can, however, access a large cavern to the east
or progress further into the tunnels to the north.
   You can just make out a pool of stagnant water to the south and decide it
may not be wise to travel in that direction.

pool~
At one time it was sea water, but as the level of the ocean dropped over
the years and without heat and sunlight to evaporate it, this pool of water
remains. Looking at it, it appears to be quite deep further to the south.

Swimming in a Stagnant Pool~
   Defying the laws of nature and science, this pool has spawned a type
of algae which continues to flourish here despite the lack of food, fresh
water and light. The smell is almost overpowering and it would be wise not
to remain here for too long.

   A vortex of sea air engulfs you and is then gone as quickly as it arrived.
You can see a faint glow coming from the tunnel to the south and the sounds
of the sea are strong here, leading you to believe the exit from this system
is nearby. You can travel to the west, south or east into the tunnels.

or it could take only a few minutes and you would be free from the confines
of the tunnels. For now, you can only travel back to the east.

   The tunnel doesn't progress too much further before ending in a wall of
rock. However, much work has been completed here to turn this area into
something of a food preparation area. A large cauldron sits over an open fire
while cooking tools hang from the wall. Slabs of rock serve as bench tops
and it looks as if someone is in the middle of cooking the next meal.
