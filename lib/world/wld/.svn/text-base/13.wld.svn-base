The Immortal Map Room of the Elemental Temple~
   The temple will be broken up into 6 components - the initial entry which
is now underwater, a plane for each element and a temple for the fifth element.
Players will only be able to progress to an elemental plane if they possess
the previous plane items. For example, if the player has obtained the item
from the earthen plane, they'll be taken to the aerial plane and so on. Here's
a brief map.

Beneath the Surface~
   Light filters down through the ocean surface above and is quickly swallowed
by the depths below. Small groups of fish swim by, obviously cautious of your
intrusion in their domain. Every direction looks fairly similar so you may
either swim upwards to the surface and descend into the darkness below.

Deep Beneath the Surface~
   Darkness surrounds you like a blanket and you strain your eyes in an attempt
to see anything at all that would help you regain your orientation. You can
just sense a difference in temperature and determine which way is up and
which way is down. You're not quite sure, but a hidden presence speaks to you
from the depths - then again, it could just be your imagination running wild.

The Depths of the Ocean~
   The only way you know you're skimming the ocean floor is by feeling the
sand slip between your fingers as you try to keep yourself down here. Your
ears pop under the increased pressure at this depth and how long you stay
down here is up to you, especially with the immense cold. For a brief instant,
you could have sworn you saw a flicker of light to the south.

The Depths of the Ocean~
   It is surprising that even in the darkness of the ocean depths, the fish
find a way to adapt and survive. A few of them have developed a phospherescent
skin that radiates a small amount of light - not enough to see great distances
but certainly enough to know you've arrived at the mouth of an underwater
tunnel that leads to the north and south.

The darkness of the ocean kept at bay by a magical light to the south in what
looks like a courtyard. The water temperature is also noticeably warmer in
that direction, perhaps another benefit of whatever magic inhabits this place.

north is blocked by a large rock wall. Looking upwards, you can see the
remains of a tree, somehow preserved against the ravages of the salt water
and cold temperatures.

An Underwater Courtyard~
   You find it unlikely that someone would have created this place underwater
so perhaps at some time it was on the surface. Your thoughts are supported by
a number of crumbled and fallen columns which block several areas of the
courtyard. There is something around this place, magical in nature, but you
can't quite put your finger on it.
   To the north, a rocky tunnel leads back into the depths of the ocean while
the courtyard continues to the south, west and east of here.

   You reach the edge of the courtyard and can progress no further, a rock
wall preventing travel to the north and east while a collapsed column to the
south stops you from moving in that direction. You consider swimming over the
top of it but there is a strange magic at work here that seems to keep you
firmly planted on the ground.

   At one time, this courtyard would have looked quite grand with the ocean
as its backdrop and sunlight streaming through the surrounding columns. Now,
it is just a shadow of its former glory. The columns have collapsed, the
sunlight blocked by a few hundred feet of water and all you can see around
the edge of the courtyard is a rocky wall. You can swim to the north, west
or south.

clues as to what they are for.

   You're not exactly sure what you're standing in, but it's impressive to say
the least. It's a perfectly shaped column standing approximately 10 feet high
and hollow in the center. Spirals of flame encircle the column although you
can feel no heat; the ocean waters stir about you, churned by a mystical
force; several small orbs of stone cover the ground and bubbles of air
mysteriously rise from beneath them.

   It may only be a visual illusion, but the plateau looks almost generated
rather than formed. Someone or something has gone to great efforts to construct
this place with an almost eerie precision. Every little bump in the ground
appears in another area, as if the plateau had been created using several
replicated blocks. The only difference is the rocky outcrop to the east.

A Lava Pool~
   The sphere that surrounds the island has the unique ability to distort
light that provides for an interesting effect. There is an eerie orange glow
created by the bursts of flames that leap from the lava pool. Any flames
that reach the surface of the sphere create a rippling effect that spreads
out around the sphere.

A Lava Pool~
   Steam gently rises from the ground and wafts upwards before disappearing
completely. Lava laps at the edge and small pools are left to cool, perhaps
adding to the islands' growth. There is no heat being radiated from either
the lava or the flames on its surface, leaving you slightly perplexed.

The Fiery Plane~
   You stand on a slab of cooled, volcanic lava that seems quite isolated
from anything else. You look around and discover there almost is nothing else
apart from similar slabs at very locations around you. Other than that, there
is only darkness. In the middle of the slab is a strange column that rotates
slowly.

A Churning Whirlpool~
   Rough waters toss you back and forth as you fight to keep your head above

to move you around, does not appear to be sucking you down. There is a column
of water around you, its origin from the depths of the whirlpool itself.

The Temple of Elements~
   There are a number of pews lining the temple wall, each appears to have
an elemental symbol etched into. You take the time to sit down on a couple of
them and images of places far beyond this world enter your mind. Some you
recognise, most you do not - it is a very therapeutic experience.

The Elemental Plane~
   One minute your ascending through the opening in the temple roof, and the
next you are floating towards the top of a large sphere in openness. Around
the sphere is nothing, only blackness - orbitting at some distance are four
other spheres, all smaller than this one. There is an incredible power and
you are almost paralysed with its intensity.

A Tropical Island~
   The island isn't very large and you imagine if the ocean swell were to
rise sufficiently, it would be submerged. A single palm tree stands to your
right and a stone cross sits embedded within the soft sand.

cross~
It's simply that - a cross carved from stone. Even with the sand, it does
not move and shows no sign of age.

On the Ocean~
   You are floating above the churning surface of the water.  As 
you float above the surface, eddies crash into you, forcing you to 
pay attention to the water's motion.  In the distance, you can see 
the foam of a broken ocean eddies. To the north, a lone island breaks
the surface of the waves.
