The Immortal Map Room~

Here is an entrance way to a very interesting zone.  There is a lot of
trickery involved in the location of rooms and exits.  Please let me know
if there are any bugs or glitches.  There is no map.  This zone consists of
about 190 rooms that are fairly loosely connected, so I don't even want to
try and show it.  The best way to find your way about this zone is to do it
just as a mortal would, walk around and explore.  You can go down to the 
beginning room.  There is a sign floating here.

A Strange Doorway~
   You are in some kind of strange portal.  You are standing, but when you
look though the portal, you appear to be staring at the sky, almost as though
you were lying down.  You have to go up to climb out of here, or you can go
south to return to the hallway.

This is a weird feeling.  You are standing on level ground, but when you look
directly in front of you you appear to be looking directly at the ground 5 feet
below you.  This is nearly nauseating.  You have to drop down to get onto a
grassy field or you can return south to the hallway.

You are standing a some kind of doorway peering into the relative darkness of
a tunnel.  There is a flurry of activity ahead of you.  There are two pairs
of glowing eyes staring about the tunnel, but they do not seem to notice
you at all.  The tunnel is just north of here, or you can return south to
the hallway.

An Office~

This was probably a really nice place in its day.  Now it is just a tattered,
old, dusty place.  The carpeting is all britty and shotty.  There is a big,
old, dark wooden desk facing the door with a nice leather chair behind it.
Thers is a painting on one wall and that is about all.  Whoever used to work
here moved out and didn't leave a whole lot.  You can go back to the top
of the stairs by heading north.

A Machine Room~

What a strange room, you are surrounded by black pipes, and wires, and all
sorts of other contraptions.  There is a hatch with a handle that is partially
open.  The only exit is back through the hatch to the east.

How strange.  It looks like a little doorway, but there is no man that could
fit through it.  As you peer into the small gap you notice the glowing 
flame and begin to notice how hot it really is here.

A Passenger Cabin~

You are standing in some sort of an isle, kind of like you would be in a
church.  There are some major differences though, the seats are plush, and
individual, nothing like a bench or pew.  Some of the seats are facing each
othere with a small table seperating thim, like you be in a tavern or nice
resteraunt.  What a nice, clean, safe place it seems to be.

This room is very similar to the one you just exited.  Except there is
no exit to the outside, only east and west.  The same style seats are in
this room, as are some small tables.  Coctail tables perhapse?  It is all
very clean and seems very safe.

You are standing in some kind of isle.  There are plush seats lining
this inside of this long, fairly narrow room.  Between some of the seats
are some small tables.  I suppose one could put drinks or snacks on them.
The room seems to be set up for comfort.  It is clean, and apears safe.
There is an exit to the outside to your south, and there are two more
of these plush rooms just east and west of here.

This is another one of those long, plush rooms.  It boggles you why anyone
would need this much room, or this much comfort.  There are exits to the
east and west.  There is no way to get outside from here, maybe if you
go into another room you can.

You are in a long narrow room.  As you peer around you you note that this
room is a little different than those to your east or west.  This room
is half filled with plush chairs and little tables, but also has some kind
of dining area and a bar at one end.  Whoever used this place had plenty
of wealth.  You can go outside to the south or stay inside by going east
or west.

This is much like the rooms around it.  There are those same plush seats
and little tables.  Gosh, someone had to have been loaded to afford a place
like this.  Maybe they left some valuables for the taking?  You can leave
either to the east or the west.

This seems to be the end of a long set of rooms.  It is quite long but only
has an exit to the outside tou your self and a open doorway to the west.
There are a lot of plush seats in a aisle here.  Most are facing in one
direction, but some are facing each other with small tables between them.
Quite a nice place, and it seems fairly safe too.

North-West Corner~

You are at a corner of the huge tower.  There is no visible source of light
buy you seem to be doing okey with it.  Since you are right along side the
wall, you can get a good look at its construction.  It is made up of very
regular peices of a uniform grey stone.  This would be an incredible 
construction project... if it were man made, but that is unlikely.  You
can go east and south from here, along the wall.

North Side~

You are along the north wall of this huge open room.  It is quite an eiree
place.  One might think being this open and made of stone, there would
be a huge echo, thing is though... you can barely hear your own footsteps.
You can go south, east, and west from here.  The stairway up is to the
south-east.

North Side~

You are along the northern wall of this huge stone room.  There is not much
here, it looks pretty empty.  But, it is quite dark and the light is making
the shadows dance, so who knows for sure?  You can go east back toward the
door, west toward the north-west corner, or south, where a huge stairway
leading up is.

North Side~
You are up along side the north wall of this huge room.  It is a strangly
quiet place.  Too quiet perhapse? The north-east corner is to your east,
there is a large stairway leading up to the south-west, and far to the
west is a large wooden door.  You can go east, south, or west from here.

North=East Corner~

You are in the far north-east corner of this huge stone room.  Although
it is quite dark in here, you can make out the enormous size of the place
just by catching glimpses.  There is a stairway in the middle of the room,
to the south-west, and you can head south or west along the walls.

A Courtyard~

You are in a small courtyard, you know you have been here before...  There
was a portal here, wasn't there?  Either way, there isn't now and the only
exit is to the east.  This courtyard looked to be quite a place in its day,
but it is all dreary now.  There is a large wooden doorway leading to a
huge tower.

The Entrance Way~
This is the main entrance to the old, large tower.  It isn't exactly like
any entrance you have ever seen before, however.  Really if it wasn't for
the large wooden door to the west, it would be just like any other part of
the room.  The room itself is absolutly huge.  It is built of some sort of
grey stone with support columns every few meters.  There is a stairway
leading up to the east.  You can go east, north, or south and stay in the
room or you can go west throught the doorway.

You are in the exact middle of this huge room.  There is a wide stairway
leading up from here, it seems to another large room.  You can also go in
any of the four cardinal directions.  There is a huge wooden door a ways to
the west.

A Field~

You are at the end of a large battlefield.  The portal from which you came is
not here.  Like it or not you have to find another way out.  It looks as
though some kind of battle has been going on for centuries.  The grass here
is basically non-existent and the bones of people killed long ago are only
partially buried.  There is some clanging in the air.

A Tunnel~

After you step out of the door way it seems to disappear.  You are left
peering down dark tunnel.  Since the door is gone you have no choice but to
leave to the east, the only exit.

A Dusty Road~

The door from where you came has disappeared.  You are standing at the edge
of a old, dusty town on an equally dusty road.  You can go west into town
or east away from town, but the road to the east looks strange, wierd, oh,
it is probablly nothing to worry about.

A Large Path~

You are on a wide dirt path, more of a road actually.  The portal from where
you came is no longer there.  Looks like you need to find another way out.
As you thought the road leads east and west from here.  And there is a large
wooden platform to your north.  You can see some sort of building in that
direction. You don't see a soul around.

You have enterered a small courtyard, the portal from which you came is gone.
There is only one way out now, and that must be to the east.  There are some
old flower beds here, but everything is dead and withering, not much to look
at that is for sure.
