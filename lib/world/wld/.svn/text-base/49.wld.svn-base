A Volcanic Tunnel~
   You are standing in a steam-filled vent.  Walls of sulfur and pumice
converge in a dome above you to form a rough ceiling.  The floor of the
vent hosts a small rivulet of dark, impure lava no more than a hand's
breadth wide which runs westward into the open air from the south.
   The vent continues to the south.

A Volcanic Vent~
   A trail of lava burns into the igneous floor here, winding its way
northward from the bend to the east to exit the chamber in a rivulet of
molten rock.  The walls to the west and south emit a sulfurous steam,
obscuring your vision in the vent as hot air blasts by you, rushing to
escape to the outside.
   Your ears are beginning to pop a bit, and you know that the pressure
will only get worse as you venture deeper into the volcano.

A Street Corner~

ooze elementals judging by the muddy texture of their bodies, shamble past
you in their lumbering gait, completely ignoring the lesser beings in their
path.
   The street continues to the south, where you can see the wall of the
fortress keep at the end, and to the east where beings stroll in and out
of a gaming house.

clawed tracks of some sort of beast mar and scatter the gravel beneath 
you.
   To the north, the street turns sharply eastward around a corner, while

little patience arguing with an elemental lord.  Wisps of smoke and a
few shooting streams of yellowish blood streak from the scene of the
brawls, mostly ignored by the others in the bazaar.

probably obsidian, absorbing the flickering torchlights and wispglows

Chamber Of The Undead~
   Fleshless undead daemons stand in uniform ranks here, each quiet and
lifeless, awaiting enchantment of undead life.
   The smooth walls of this obsidian chamber reflect the images of the
undead, making the dozen or so in here seem like an army of hundreds,
each gazing in a different direction and leaving no part of the room
unseen.
   Only the monstrous beings appear to inhabit this room which lies
bereft of furniture or similar items.  Fortunately, they show no signs

of dead daemon guards.  Lined along the wall here, the dead stare out
from behind glassy, dry eyes, no longer exuding fire, frost, or toxic
gases as they did in life.
   Still, you feel as though they may come to life.
   Tearing for gaze from them, you notice a large chamber to the north,
a portcullis of wrought iron forbidding your passage, while the hall

tunnel continues.
   As you stand still to check the air, you notice a faint breeze of
cooler air coming from the eastern tunnel, as though the heart of the
mountain itself was dormant.

glistening and their tails swishing in delight as they devour their meal.

   Though unimpressive, the wrought iron gate leading into the castle's
main keep appear to be both sturdy and functional.  Flanked by two guards
on each side, the gate remains tightly closed and, judging by the stern
looks you receive from the guards, off limits to anyone who is uninvited.
   The keep rises high above you to the south, while to the north, the
bustling activity in the bazaar seems to be a delightful distraction from
the terrors and risks of living in the undermountain.

of a dart.

carved into the floor.  In it, you can hear the crackling of blackfire

fire daemons.

dimming the room to a dusky orange, making the gems seem dull and
lackluster.
   A grand central table dominates the room, though it is empty and 
seems to have been carved from mahogany.
   You can see only the exit you came from here.

A Misty Tunnel~
   You are standing in a secret tunnel deep within the fortress.  Strange,
swirling mists float around you, stinging you with their energy which sets
your hair on end.  The walls here seem to be whispering for you to turn
back.
   Heavy breathing seems to be coming from the south, as though some old
dragon was deep in slumber.

Deep Within A Fissure~

from further in the fissure below.

scent of your body.

you while a stray horn or spike prods you to move on from behind.
   The cavern seems to end here, with only the gate of the fortress
to break the monotony of solid walls rising above you to the north and 
east.  You can also escape the pack by bolting to the south, though

that rush past you as they go about their own business.  Before you,
an ice daemon slaps a forked, lizardlike tongue against your cheek,
stinging you with its cold, as though telling you to get away from
him.
   As you look around, trying to exit the crowd, you notice that the
cavern wall rises high to the east and slopes above you to form the
dome of the undermountain itself.  To the west, the fortress wall
stands tall, patrolled by tailed, weaponed beasts at its peak.

outbuildings and the well-lit bazaar that rests behind the fortress
wall.
   As you look out from your perch, some 200 feet above the cavern floor,
you notice the abundance of guards at the fortress gate far to the
north, as well as the patrols that monitor the activity within.  Far
over the western wall, you can see daemons haggling the prices of their
goods as they set up stalls in a bazaar.

with moisture as are the stairs that lead up.

in the past, a pocket of magma drained away from this place, leaving a flat
cavern floor and a domed ceiling nearly two hundred feet above you.
   Towers and structures of basalt, obviously constructed rather than natural,
have turned this cavern into a subterranean city.  Clawed footprints mar
the courtyard where you have entered, indicating that this is a high-traffic
area for the inhabitants of this city.
   To the north, you can see the side of a building, while to the south,
smooth cavern walls rise and slope above you.  As you look west, you

wares from their own native lands.

and shelves which stand along the circular stone walls.  
   A circular dias on which an altar of some sort has been built rests
in the center of the room, a black crystal floating above it, seemingly
absorbing the light and emitting its own inky colour around you.
   Through your searching, you come across a door set into the eastern
wall, its stone hinges set to last an eternity.  Its twin, carved with a
relief of stars and other celestial objects lies in the western wall,
where a damp, almost humid, scent of vapour originates.

   Here, the stairs have opened onto a small landing blocked with a solid
stone door which seems to radiate an intense, biting cold.  An iron handle,
wrought and twisted from what appears to have been a dull blade, rests
firmly attached to the stone, obviously meant to be pulled outward, rather
than pushed.
   The stone wall of the tower lies unblemished as you cast your eyes
southward and to the east, while the gaping darkness seems to hold some

over the passage of many years.  Smooth walls and curved floors form an
almost perfect cylinder in this cave which leads south, further into
the undermountain.

Bones And Scales~
   You seem to have stumbled into a cemetary of some sort.  Acid-washed
exoskeletons and scales of dead daemons litter this place, a dead-end
in an acid-carved tunnel.
   A small altar rests in the southern wall, obviously a carved niche
into which a daemon skull rests, its hollow eye sockets gleaming yellow
as it watches over the dead.
   The only exit is to the north.

A Cavern~
   You are walking in a high-ceilinged cavern.  No stalactites hang from
above as these tunnels show evidence of volcanic activity which long
since dissolved any limestone formations had they been present.
   The tunnel continues to both the east and west, growing misty and
clouded as you head away.

Chamber Of The Pits~
   Glyphs and magical wards adorn the smooth walls and ceiling of this
frigid chamber.  In the floor, five shallow pits have been carved, each
a semi-spherical bowl in which sigils have been scribed.  Power, dark
power, radiates in this room.  
   A single door lies in the southern wall while a small crevasse can
be seen flawing the glyphs on the eastern wall.

A Burning Corridor~
   You are standing in what could only be a volcanic vent.  Smoke and fire
rises up from the smouldering floor, filling the air with a burning, choking 
ash.  The walls themselves boast crystals of hot sulfur and seem to melt
in the intense heat.
   The corridor continues to the south, where it grows even hotter.  To the
north however, a cold mist seeps from under the door, creating a vortex of
roiling steam at its base.

A Searing Tunnel~
   Smoke billows from the streaming lava that bubbles and flows backwards
into the heart of the mountain.  The eastern and western walls show strong
signs of melting and molten sulfur drips onto the tunnel floor, creating
a toxic gas as it splashes into the lava streams.
   The tunnel continues to the south, though it seems to look more stable
to the north.

A Flame Geyser~
   Bluish fire spews upward from a vent here in the floor, boring a small
chimney in the tunnel ceiling.  Molten sulfur drips into the flame, creating
a yellowish gas which chokes you despite your magical protection from the
hellish elements.
   The tunnel continues southward through the flames and northward into
an unstable tunnel.

A Volcanic Chimney~
   You stand at the top of a chimney.  Superheated air mixes with ash here
to create a thick smoke which blinds you as you stare down into the depths 
of the hole.  The walls, dripping with molten sulfur and other minerals,
form rivulets into the pit that get spewed out during the updrafts from 
below.
   The exit of the tunnel lies to the north, where the tunnel gradually
melts away like the southern, eastern, and wested walls here.

In The Chimney~
   You are floating, buffeted by streams of superheated air and ash.  As
you rise and fall, you feel that you can manipulate the currents, riding
the cooler ones to descend into the chimney while floating on hotter ones
to rise.
   All around you, the walls of the chimney are scarred with a blackened
crystal amidst the dense black rock that composes the core of the mountain.
   Below you, you can see nothing but are aware of the occasional geyser
of ash that disrupts the currents and spins you around.

   You are floating above a massive pool of magma.  Through the waves of
heat, you can make out the enormous mass of fiery liquid which bubbles and
shoots forth flames below you.
   Oddly enough, you notice a cavern opening up below you to the south,
just beyond the range of the pool.  The reddish glow of the magma lights
the area in a hellish crimson.
   Above you, ash and smoke roil in the currents of air.

back the molten rock.

the constant scent of sulfur that seems to dominate the walls and floors 
of the hellish cavern.

   A cold mist rises from a deep shaft here which leads deep into the
base of the mountain.  Screams and shouts of agony whisper their faint
torments on the vapours which brush your ears, making you wonder if you
imagined the horrid calls of distress.
   Above you, a single stalactite points into the shaft, standing a
silent vigil over the frigid fog.

   You can hear nothing as you negotiate the powerful air currents which
scream past your ears.  Your clothes, wet with the cold mist which rises
from within the shaft, cling to you, freezing you as the moisture in the
sodden fabric rubs into your skin.
   The walls of the shaft are smooth and slick with water, making purchase
impossible.
   Staring down, you notice a faint glow.  A pale, almost sickly, blue
light seems to radiate from deep within the shaft below you.

growing larger as yellow tendrils of mist swirl around the light below.
   The wet walls prevent you from getting a foothold in any direction.  
You can only travel up or down the shaft.

   You are surrounded by a yellowish mist which sems to drag you down
toward the bluish light.  The sky-coloured luminescence seems to grow
a sickly green as you descend and the stench of sulfur begins to mix
with the ozone scent of the surronding mist.
   You are easily a quarter mile or more from the top of the shaft and
judging from the congealing moisture on the shaft walls, you have the
odd sensation that you are no longer within the mountain.
   You can descend toward the greenish light or ascend toward the 
dark top of the shaft.

shaft.  The wet walls, once slick with cold moisture, seem to drip with
a bloodlike liquid, as though the sides of the shaft themselves were 
bleeding from the abusive wind currents that shoot upwards from the
putrid greenish glow below.
   Tendrils of foul-smelling mist wind and twist around you, somehow
still cohesive despite the strong constant air currents from below.

   Frozen red liquid hangs in slanted streaks on the shaft walls, victim to
the gusts which blast from the sickly yellow-green light below.  The misty
tendrils are still writhing here, oblivious to the winds and to your touch
as you pass through them.
   The glow beneath you turns pale yellow as you grow closer to it.
   Examining your options, you know that you are half a mile below the
top of the shaft which is far out of sight in the darkness above you.
Below you, you can see the mists swirl and you catch a strong scent of
sulfur.

ice here tinting the yellowish tendrils to an ethereal orange.  Below you,
perhaps a half mile or more, the swirling, pulsing glow grows more intense.
Already, the sickly fog is becoming more luminous, changing into a bright
yellowish ochre.

winds below you.

icy blood-coloured rime, seem to fluoresce with the illumination from
below.
   Above you, perhaps a mile or more, the top of the shaft lies far out of 
sight and reach.  Below you, the burgundy mists seem to solidify and you
can swear you hear faint shrieks of pain coming from them.

   Just below you lies an enormous circular field of light.  Swirls of
luminescent pink swim with and consume streaks of blood crimson as
wispy tendrils of yellow mist take vague shape here.
   Around you, the tentacle-like wisps form humanoid faces, each one
gaping a soft, near-silent scream as it escapes from the light below.
   The cold here is unbearable and you are quickly losing feeling in your
extremeties.  Below you, the circle of light mesmerizes you and invites
you closer, though above you, the shaft grows warmer and seems far less
dangerous.

The Gate~
   Ethereal beings are trying to escape out of this multi-coloured rift.
Clearly, the pain on their transparent faces is all that needs to be seen
to know that travelling through the rift is much more costly than a simple
jaunt through the lights.
   From below the rift, you can feel a frigid cold pass though the field
of light, as though a glacier was housed beneath it.  The being seem to be
anxious to escape more than the cold however, judging by the looks of mixed
terror and relief as they soar past you.
