Coastal Savanna~
   You are standing in a field of lush yellow grass, overlooking the
ocean to the north.  Here, the ocean breezes fling wisps of sea spray,
misting the grass around you with moisture that quickly gets robbed
by the desert to the southwest.
   The savanna grasses continue to the south and east, growing more
arid as you head toward the desert to the west.

Savanna Grasslands~
   You are wading through a field of tall grass.  The air is dry here,
the moisture absorbed by the plants around you.  A few patchy mounds
lie nearby, probably insect-constructed and offering nothing in terms
of elevation or interest.
   The savanna continues to the south and east, growing more colorful
as you head north toward the coast.  To the west the grasses become

Watering Hole~
   This secluded pool appears to have been hidden by nature as there was
no indication of its existence when viewed from afar.  The water is warm
and murky but offers sustenance against the arid surroundings.
   A tree, no higher than you are tall, sprouts from the far edge of the
pool, its leafy green limbs contrasting nicely with the yellow reeds of
the savanna.
   The savanna continues in all directions, growing drier as you head west.

Savanna Grasses~
   You are wading through a field of tall grass.  The air is dry here,
the moisture absorbed by the plants around you.  A few patchy mounds
lie nearby, probably insect-constructed, and offering little in terms
of shade.  A tall stone wall of a castle or keep rises high to the
east, bearing the scars of savanna storms and weather.
   The savanna continues to the east, west, and south, growing more
colorful as you head north toward the coast.

Savanna Mounds~
   You are standing amid buzzing insects that seem to be digilently
adding mud to the already tall spires of their nests.  There seems
to be plenty of moisture around here as the grasses grow rich and
green while the savanna shrubs give way to the first of the trees
that offer refreshing shade from the daytime sun and shelter from 
the cold nighttime winds.
   The savanna continues to the north, growing arid as you head to
the west.  To the east the grasses seem to retain their color, while
to the south, the foliage becomes thicker and more temperate.

Thickening Foliage~
   You are standing in some waist-high brush and scrub on the border
of a dense jungle to the south and the savanna lands to the north.
To the east the grasses seem to retain their color as they grow against
the backdrop of the wall of a keep, while to the south, the foliage
becomes extremely dense and jungle-like.

Jungle Foliage~
   You are standing at the border of a tropical jungle.  Tall, leafy
trees - typical of rainforests - drip their condensing moisture on the
ground here, forming small puddles of water.
   The elevation seems to rise a bit to the south, as the savanna lands
to the north give way to the mountainous rainforests to the south.  
   From somewhere off to the south, behind impenetrable foliage, you can
hear the rushing of water.
