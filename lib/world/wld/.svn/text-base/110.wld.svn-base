The Desert~
   Black dunes rise from the desert landscape around you. No signs of life
are to be seen, and you wonder what made you come here. A huge cave opens
under a sand-covered shelf of rock to the west.

   Sand chafes your skin and blinds your eyes as you sink to your ankles
in this black sand that stretches in all directions save north, where a
rock outcropping offers a bit of shade, though is too tall to climb.

little in sight that makes the journey here exciting or adventurous, 
except for the rock outcropping that spans the northern horizon and 
breaks up an otherwise boring scene.

unclimbable height to the north.  Great billows of sand shoot into the sky,
driven by the strong wind.

crushing death.

rapidly in size to the west.  Quickly, you rush away from the deadly
region and head for more stable ground.

   To the west, a few sandholes appears.  Occasionally, a huge worm raises
its head from the orifice, only to plunge back into sand. It appears that
there must be a solid shelf of rock beneath you as the sand, though warm,
is firmly packed, as though it is resting upon something solid.

refreshing water after many days in the desert.
   There also seems to be another anomaly to the west, as geysers of sand
spew up from the desert floor to create earthen rains and sinkholes in that
direction.  You quickly assess the footing and decide against traveling to
the west.

The Cobblestone Road~
   This small road of cobblestones seems to be the last vestiges of some
civilization.   All around, tall dunes cast shadows on the road the winds
west and north.

A Dark Weapons Shop~
  Candles on the wall illuminate the room just enough for you to see all the
full weapons' racks on the walls.  Apparently the Rakshasa aren't a peaceful
bunch.  You cannot seem to find the keeper of all these weapons, so you are
wary, careful not to turn your back for too long to the dark corner of the
room.  He may be hiding there.  A large sign hangs on the wall.  There is
a door to the east.

A Path Along the Wall~
   Rakshasan citizens travel along this path, ignoring the blandness of the
decorations and the lack of vegetation of the village, and directing their
attentions to other business.
   To the east, at the end of this east-west road, a large hut stands open.

A Straw Hut~
   This is where the Rakshasan citizens live.  The hut is made of a straw and
mud mixture and displays only a rug on the floor and a table in the corner.
On the table are some bones, though it is hard to make out whether they are
the bones of humans or some animal.
   To the west an exit leads to the street.

The Dry Dusty Desert~
   The sand is not as fine here as it was farther north, and cacti grow more
abundantly. To the west a trail worn of sand leads around a high spiked fence.

A Step Into The Canyon~
   You seem to be caught in some sort of cross wind as you make your plunge
into the canyon. Suddenly, you realize that not even a magical ward of flying
would be sufficient to stop the winds from dashing you into the hard, sharp
surface of the canyon walls that pierce and batter you.
   Mercifully, you begin to lose consciousness before you reach the thrusting
spire below you and you take consolation in the fact that your death is not
a slow one.

     Your blood is their life, and your life is taken easily.
                      Beware the Pagan Hordes!
     Your possessions are your mark, and their mark is of the Beast.

The Muddy Tunnel~
Inching yourself along on hands and knees, you begin to feel like heading back
for a more easily accessible way past the mountains.

The Muddy Tunnel~
The crawlspace enlarges to let you walk, although stooped over, at a faster
pace through the tunnel. A narrow slit in the wall leads north, and the tunnel
continues east.

In the Underground River~
The shallow river runs rapidly here over smooth stones. You sip a little,
and it tastes fantastic after so many days in the hot sun. You can follow
the river to the east, or head north into a muddy tunnel. A small stream of
water from the ceiling has created a natural well here.

In the Underground River~
The sound of splashing water echoes from the east. The water seeps into the
links of your armor, making the sand grit even more harshly against your skin.

Sand swirls all around you in a blinding mist. All directions appear the same,

Entrance to the Tunnel~
A hole in the sand to the west leads under a small dune. The storm to the west
causes sand to pour steadily into the opening, threatening to seal off the
entrance at any time. Although the threat of being buried alive scares you, the
darkness looks inviting after so long in the blinding sun and sand.

The Edge of the Storm~
The black sand at your feet jumps into the air as a freak storm suddenly
springs right on top of you. The air is dark with gale force winds to the west
while a short distance east it is calm and peaceful, though still hellishly
hot.

The black sand at your feet jumps into the air as a freak storm suddenly

while a short distance east it is calm and peaceful, though still hellishly

deep canyon south of you.

Outside the Abandoned Citadel~
The crest on the doors before you shows this to be the ancient Citadel, used
by the Knights of Solamnia as a meeting place for strategic planning against
the forces of the dark pagan hordes. History says that evil magic besieged the 
Citadel with their magical arts, forcing it open and slaying all within.
When the last tortured scream of the knights died out, they perversed their
spirits with the forces of the entire black coven, and banished the Citadel 
here as a last insult to the brave knights that tried to defend their homeland.
