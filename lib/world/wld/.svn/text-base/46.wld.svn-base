Lost In The Swamp of Sadness~
   A petrified tree trunk snags on your boot just beneath the surface of
the swamp. You fall to one knee, cursing the desire that brought you into
this accursed place.

   The swamp is impassable in all directions but west here; petrified trees
stand at strange angles to the swamp floor, barring your way and blocking out 
the meager light of the sun far above.

blocks your path.  Creepers of vine and dead foliage drape down from the
dark covering of the swamp trees that grow above you.
