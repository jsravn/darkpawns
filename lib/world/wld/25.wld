Standing on a Sandbar~
   This is the western tip of a small sandbar at what looks like the entrance
to a larger bay to the south. Although the sandbar is high enough to keep
you dry, the sand itself is quite moist and is difficult to move through.

Standing on a Sandbar~
   You are on a narrow strip of sand which runs east-west. Further to the
east you can see a wooden jetty which may have berthed one or two ships in
its time. To the south, the calmer waters of a large bay look slightly more
inviting than the ocean waves.

Standing on a Sandbar~
   Waves sweep forward from the surrounding ocean to the north but the
sandbar you are on prevents any further travel to the south where you can
see much calmer waters. You can travel to the east or west along the sandbar,
south into the sheltered bay or north into the ocean waves.

   You emerge from the thickness to the south and the view before you leaves
you breathless. Standing at the top of an 80-foot cliff, the world around
you is amazing to say the least. Ocean waves crash against the cliff face
to the west while the waters of the island lagoon lap calmly to the east.
Behind you, the island you find yourself on is covered in all forms of
plant-life which make travel look difficult.
   Towards the southwestern corner of the island you can see a fairly large
wooden structure but you have no idea on how you're going to get there.

   Your trek ends here overlooking a magnificient view of the ocean, its
waves crashing into the base of the cliff upon which you stand. Looking down,
several trees are actually growing horizontally from the cliff face providing
good nesting places for sea birds.
   To the south, you can just make out a narrow dirt path and what looks like
a wooden gate.

A Prison Cell~
   The cell is very small and is in no way comfortable - although you would
expect prisoners would not be afforded the luxuries of law abiding citizens.
It has become something of a storeroom, shreds of clothing of crude weapons
have been dumped on the floor. Decomposed bodies, or parts thereof, have
been hung from the bars to dry.

The Prison Entrance~
   You stand at the southern end of a narrow passage which provides access
to three prison cells on the western side of the building. A door to the
east leads into a small walkway. The sounds of vermin scurrying away are
everywhere, as is the dried blood and bones. The bars have long since rusted
from the salt air and any piece of wood has become a haven for all forms of
fungi.

   The rough walkway turns here and proceeds to the north and east. What
remains of a door lies to the west, providing access to a larger building
compared to those around it. The word "freedom" has been carved into the door
with a crude instrument and the smell of death is very strong from within.

A Small Walkway~

Moisture is rich in the air and it's not long before you sweat profusely with
the intense humidity.

various parts of their once whole bodies.

dirt path leads away to the north into the dense jungle.

west.

ocean. Rough waves crash into the cliff faces, an extensive reef preventing
anything from coming remotely close to the island. There is, however, a
sandbar on the northern side which would allow a ship to dock if it were
careful enough.
   You're almost blown from your vantage point by the now strong wind which
cuts through your armor and clothes. The bell that hangs here is no more than
a rusted shell, incapable of creating very much noise. Stairs are the only
exit from the top of the tower.
