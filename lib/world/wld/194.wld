A Mountain Pass~
  You are standing at the edge of a narrow pass through these mountains.
The air here is cold and the elevation is dizzying, your view of the land
below is partially obscured by cloud cover.  Before you, you see a rocky, narrow
switchback that leads even higher up into the mountains. Dense clouds
obscure your view up the mountain after awhile, although you can acertain
that the peak is much higher than you can see at the moment.  The narrow
pass continues to the north.

There are no signs of recent travel however; the trail is rocky and
overgrown. The top of the mountain is still very difficult to see.

   As you come around a bend in the path you see that there have been 
steps carved into the side of the mountain. The steps lead several 
hundred feet up to the gates of a temple. From the temple can be heard 
a low, eerie hum, which sounds strangely familiar at times.  The mist 
is still very thick here, and you can tell that there are even higher 
peaks above this section of the mountain.

Before the Temple~

mountain. The rock has been carved and polished to be as smooth as 
marble. It shows no signs of time or the elements. The temple itself 
looks to be the same as any traditional Shaolin temple. To each side of 
the last flight of stairs to the entrance are two huge dragons carved 
from obsidian. In each dragon's mouth burns an eerie, unnatural fire. 
The low humming you heard as you approached is now discernible as 
chanting coming from deep within the temple.

well-used mats lie strewn across the floor for meditation purposes.
Beneath a cyclopean sandstone sculpture of the Buddha, there is a 
simple raised wooden platform. It is from here that the master of the 
temple leads the others in meditation and reflection.  In the dim 
candlelight of this end of the sanctorum, you notice robed figures
moving about with a sense of purpose in the darkness.  Even from here
you can still hear the endless chanting echoing off the walls and
ceilings of this place.

small pagoda.  Further from your sight, you notice what could be another
complex on the east side of the mountain. Looking up you can see an odd
building, clearly a pagoda, at the mountain's peak.  It appears to be much
bigger than the one at the base of the mountain.
   The clouds surround you here.  Oddly enough, this high up they feel
unusually warm.

question your motives for negotiating this pine branch.  The limb sways
slightly in the wind.
   As you look back up, you notice what was glimmering before is in fact
a fire falcon. It slowly turns towards you and takes to flight, shaking
the limb violently.  You hear a loud creaking come from the limb and,
suddenly, you feel weightless as the limb gives way.
   High above you can hear the shrill cry of the falcon, its shriek a
mocking laughter as you plummet to your death.

The room itself is presumably where guests wait to be announced to the

obviously used for assembling large groups of people, but as for what
purpose, you cannot tell.  The floor is made of a highly polished wood,
possibly teak, and creaks and flexes as you walk on it, as though it is
suspended above the natural flooring. Giant basalt pillars hold up the
ceiling; you wonder how the floor can possibly support their weight.
A broad flight of stone steps leads upward in the northern part of this 
room, and the rest of the room extends in all directions.

on the ground floor of this pagoda.  Many torches line the walls of this 
chamber, but it doesn't seem to help the light any; it is as if the walls 
absorb the torches energy inside of allowing it to radiate into the room.  
Hot, fibrous refuse drips continually from the torches, and you wonder 
how they can possibly afford to have a wooden floor with all this open 
flame around.  Upon closer inspection of the floor, however, you notice 
that it has been treated with a wax-like substance which is apparently 
fireproof, judging by the condition of the wood.  Men in crimson robes 
attend to the torches ceaselessly, their cowls pulled up over their faces.

pillars, in corners, and suspended on heavy iron chains from the flat
ceiling.  Funny thing that the torches don't seem to be providing much 
light -- probably because of the immense size of the chamber.

thousands of torches, candles, and braziers in this one chamber alone.
The building itself seems to be absorbing the energy from these torches
as the walls seem fairly warm to the touch.  Perhaps these torches are
what is fueling the flaming aura that surrounds the outside of this
place.

sends an eerie chill down your spine.  The men in crimson robes walk
about this chamber with great urgency, chanting eerily as they do so.

Fire Pagoda~
   This floor looks to be much the same as the one below it, teak flooring 
and basalt columns supporting a flat ceiling.  Torches, braziers, and 
other open flames burn everywhere, as before.  This level, however, has
four large windows: two set in the eastern wall, and two set opposite
them in the western.  The windows look out into the clouds through a
fiery veil, the same that surrounds the temple from the outside.  The
chanting of the servants of the pagoda seems louder here than it did 
before, and the room extends to another upward flight of stairs to the 
south.

Fire Pagoda~
   The second level of the pagoda seems to be much the same as the first, 
except that this level seems unnaturally warm.  Perhaps it is because of 
the large column of flame that leaps from the floor to the southeast of 
here, almost in the exact centre of the room.  Torches, smudge pots, 
braziers, and all manner of other devices designed to protect fire are 
scattered haphazardly about this chamber, tended by the Servants and 
their acolytes.

Fire Pagoda~
   The pagoda looks eerie from your angle, the interior light buffeting 
and reflecting from the glow in the windows, making crazed, jagged-edged
angles on the walls and columns.  The servants of the Flame move in and
out of these shadowed angles rapidly, like flies buzzing around a fresh
corpse, or moths to a flame.

Fire Pagoda~
   You stand in the glow from a gigantic window on this level.
Everything outside looks orange, as you gaze through the soft
flame-like glow. Not like there is much to see, of course; 
Thick cloud-cover prevents you from seeing anything save the 
highest peaks of the Grey Mountains.

A Column of Flame~
   The centre of this chamber is dominated by a huge column of flame 
that ejaculates from the floor.  The flame is contained by magical
runes carved on the floor and the ceiling.  The flame itself appears
to continue through the ceiling on to the roof.
   The second floor extends in all directions from here.

Fire Pagoda~
   You stand in the shadow of a broad flight of stone steps that lead
to the next level directly to the east.  Tall red candles guard the
sides of each step as they ascend.  Hot, sticky air rolls down from
the steps, assaulting your senses.  The walls and floor look slightly
less glossy here than in other places, probably due to their exposure
to the elements by way of the open stairway.

Fire Pagoda~
   This is the base of the stairs that ascend into semidarkness to 
what is presumably the third and final level of the pagoda.  You
suspect that the upper level must be open and unprotected from the
elements to some degree, because hot, moist air blows down from
above, making you uncomfortable.  You notice that this moisture-
laden air has caused small patches of crimson-coloured lichen to
form on the stairs and floor here.

Fire Pagoda~
   This corner of the pagoda is abnormally damp, as if moisture was
allowed to collect here for some period of time.  The dampness is
more than likely a result of the open stairway to your west, and the
burning column of fire in the centre of the room does little to
alleviate the dampness and darkness here.  There is even a surprising
lack of torches and the like.
   Upon closer inspection, you notice that the wax-like substance that
covers the rest of the walls and floor is practically non-existent
here.  Perhaps this room isn't safe for open flame right now.

The Top Level~
   As you climb to the top level, you realize that the stairway that you
are on is set into a lipped stone well; the actual floor is behind you,
to the north.  The view into the clouds ahead of you is breathtaking
though.
   The flames around the pagoda seem to subside at the top here.  This
floor is indeed roofed, as you saw from the outside, but it is open air,
without walls.  The ceiling is instead supported by magnificent columns
of red marble.  The rest of this floor is accessible by walking around
the well to the north.

A Column of Fire~
   This is where the column of fire from the level below comes through
the floor. It continues up its magickal path through a large portal in 
the arched ceiling and out in to the night sky.  Though it appears to
be ornamental, you can only guess at its actual purpose.  The heat and
moisture here are almost unbearable, causing your clothes and armor to
stick to you when you move, and sweat to drip from your brow.  The 
floor extends to the east and west, and to the north there seems to be 
some kind of throne set up.

The Top Level~
   This is the western half of the top floor, where spirits of fire 
dance around the cylindrical pillar of flame in ecstasy.  Intense,
superheated air stirs around you, choking you with its vile thickness.
All around you are servants of the great master, Fire, and you have
no doubt that you are in his Temple.

The Top Level~
   This is the eastern half of the top level, where spirits of the flames 
dance and twist in wild ecstasy around the centre pillar of fire.  Of this 
you can have no doubt: This is the legendary shrine of Fire -- The Fire 
Pagoda.  You stand in awe of its magnificence.

On A Dais~
   You stand on a slightly elevated dais at the northern end of the top 
level of the Fire Pagoda.  All around you, flame spirits dance wildly
around the pillar of flame in the center of this place.  The magical
nature of this place is certain. This is one of the shrines of the 
elements that make up this world -- the legendary Fire Pagoda!
   Before you, on a massive golden throne, stands the master and High
Priest of this pagoda, a soft blue flame outlining his figure.
