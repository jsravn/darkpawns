The Throne Room~
  You stand among the nobles and knights of Dun Liu. Servants hurry by you 
and nobody pays much attention to you. Against the back wall stands a huge 
throne, made plush and comfortable for the King's oversized arse. Fron here
you can watch the bribes and blackmail merge all over the world. The only
exit is to the north.

The Ante Chamber~
  You are standing in the Ante Chamber. It's just another word for waiting
room, but everyone who wants to see the King must pass through it. Servants
scuttle by you in their rush to serve the King and the nobles about you. As
you walk around you notice all the expensive tapestries and artwork hanging
and begin to wonder if the King is spending the people's money on himself
instead of his people. What appears to be the throne room lies to the south,
while a great deal of noise comes from the north.

A Heavily Guarded Room~
  For some reason this room is heavily guarded. The guard rooms were well
guarded, but this room is amazing! Guards stand at their posts in a wall of
weapon-wielding maniacs. How insecure could a King be to have so much defense
within the walls of his own fortress? There are exits to the east, west, and
south.

The Royal Hallway~
  This is just another lavishly decorated room, built and decorated by the
King to make him feel more 'at home' in the lands of Dun Liu. You notice many
fine pieces of art and jewelry here. Sculptures stand tall against the walls
while expensive paintings hang behind them. It's begging to look more like an
art gallery than a castle. The Royal Hallway continues east and south.

stands at a counter, greedily counting his profits and grinning at you in a

next to the counter. The only exit is back out onto the Orange Brick Road.

A winding staircase~
  You are standing on a dark, dank staircase. As you climb up step by step
all you can see is a tiny light comming from the top. All sorts of insects
pass you on their way to forage for food. As you climb you dodge various
spider webs and disgusting little insect nests that would make any other
person vomit uncontrollably. Whoever is at the top must have a strong stomach.

A dark thicket~
  You are in a very dark thicket. All around you different trees and plants
sprout up, making everything feel like it's closing in on you. Strange noises
come from deeper into the thicket, made by some tortured animal... The road
goes back south, while the thicket continues north, east, and west.

The end of a hidden tunnel~
  The gremlin is long gone, so you must be inside the fortress. Now that
you're in, how're you going to get back?  There is a trapdoor above you.

  Welcome to the Cheese Chamber.  Here lies the various tasks Phondew set
out to complete but never has, including this area!  You notice packages
of cheese strewn about without any order in this room of chaos.  An orange
couch lies in a corner and there is a area of the room devoted to worshipping
