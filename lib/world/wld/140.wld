East Gate of the "Lion's Mouth" Arena~
A thick wooden, iron-reinforced gate rises about sixty feet high directly
west of here.  It is the only thing seperating you from one of the best-known
gladiator arenas in the world--and perhaps one of the most dangerous. A brave
man leaves surrounded by wealth and fame, a foolish man surrounded by a crude
coffin--there is no second place.  Atop the gates is a roaring lion's head of
solid gold, beckoning any would-be challengers to face the perils within.  An
oval plaque above the head reads, "The Lion's Mouth Arena."

Gladiators' Preparation Chambers~
Those who dare to brave the arena begin here, where lame but full equipment
is provided for free to registered gladiators.  It is hard not to notice the
various bloodstains and rips in some of the armours, suggesting that perhaps
the equipment provided here was recently taken off of a fallen challenger's
body.  There are some others here though, not minding the torn suits.  They
polish their various weapons silently, but with an air of confidence around
them.  It is almost like awaiting an execution, but the gladiators have a
chance to not only live but to gain fame and fortune.  Through a large arch
to the north you see the arena gate, where new entries are introduced.

The "Lion's Mouth" Arena~
You are just inside the gladiators' entrance to the arena, and your body
is already pumping adrenaline like mad.  The decapitated head of a man rolls
in from the north, and you try to scream -- you scream -- but the spectators'
bloodthirsty yells muffle every sound you make.  The confidence you had built
up just a few minutes ago has died away, eclipsed by feelings of mortality
and pure, unadulterated fear.  The arena gates are just to the east, and you
could escape if you wanted to and could face the shame.  The arena surrounds
you in all other directions, and layers of enraged spectators are above every
wall, waiting for the sight of your death.

The "Lion's Mouth" Arena~
This is the north end of the arena, where beasts are released.  It may not be
the center of the arena, but it certainly is the center of the action!  A
huge storing area is to the north, probably full of cages, but it is too dark
to see clearly.  Every once in a while, a roar comes from the storing area,
and it would not be surprising to find out the arenakeepers have a dragon or
some other marvelous creature in there.  To the south, at the southern end
of the arena, you see the exit, a much more compelling option than becoming
dinner for the next monster released.  The spectators overhead let out
deafening waves of screams and cheers, not caring who or what dies as long as
it is a bloody fight.

A trapdoor is here, but it looks well-sealed.  Its purpose is probably to
prevent your escape.

Arena Storage~
Hey!  How'd you get in here?  Guards!  Put this man in a cage! :)
(This room is not meant for mortals.  It is here to hold monsters which
are released to the arena.)
