Stone Path~
   This path is aligned with smooth stones which all look
identical in size and shape. Black candles rest on every other
stone which light the path with a faint, flickering glow. The path
continues east, and leads back to the stone walkway to the west.

Stone Path~
   The path continues to stretch around the perimeter of the stone
wall. In the distance you hear sacred chanting, which seems to
grow louder the further you head west. A large, obsidian fountain
can be seen to the south.

Path Corner~
   You stand in the north east corner of the stone path. It bends
slowly to the south as you continue onward. This courtyard reminds
you of a oriental monk's garden back on your home planet. Yet, the
monk's garden was peaceful and sacred, this place, unfortunately,
has the opposite effect.

Stone Path~
   To the south, you can hear faint chanting. You think you see
something moving in the distance, perhaps it's your imagination.
On stone wall to the east hangs a large skull with twisted
antlers. It, like the other skulls, is used as a ominous candle
holder. To the west you see a large, granite fountain. The water
seems to glow at the base.

Stone Path~
   To the west, you see a line of walkers, clothed in black cowls.
Their faces are cloaked by large, black hoods. They are all
walking single file. The leader of the line claps two blocks of
wood together in a rhythmic manner. At first with a slow,
repetitive beat, then eventually speeding up to a fast, vigorious
pulse, then he repeates the sequence again. This clapping of the
wood keeps the line moving at a stedy pace.

Stone Path~
   The path continues south towards a large building. The stones
which align the path get larger the further you walk. Apparently
the landscaping here was designed so that everything, including
the shrubbery, heightens the further south you go south. This
unique landscape seems to have been designed for aesthetic reasons
rather than for practicality.

Path Corner~
   You stand in the south east corner of the courtyard. Directly
south of you is the side of a large, black building. Celestial
windows align the upper wall, and oversized rafters hang out over
the path. There is also stainglass which depicts a fiendish tale.
In the pictorial, there is a large, black-armored knight, with
red, glowing eyes. It stands triumphantly over mounds of burning
corpses. The sinister knight raises his sword high in the air as a
sign of victory.

   To the west is the entryway to the building. There is a large,
chain-link tapestry that hangs on the south wall, and to the north
you can see the head of a stone figure peering over the hedge. On
the tapestry is a blood-red hex symbol which represents the cult's
demonic following.

Before the Entryway~
   The entryway is so tremendous, that it makes you feel like a
miniature figurine. The whole building, its ornamentation and
adornment, reflect the cult's credo: a transcendental, monolithic
entity, which rules with a sovereign aura of darkness. You hope
this is not the last form of religion in this decimated world.

Path Corner~
   You stand in the north west corner of the stone path. To the
south, you can make out what looks to be a single-file line of
monks. They walk in a compulsive, rhythmic manner. You think they
are heading your direction, until you loose sight of them. The
path curls around the perimeter of a stone wall, and fades into
the darkness to the south.

Stone Path~
   On the west wall is what looks to be a ox skull. Its thick,
twisted horns protrude out at least two feet in either direction.
It, too, is being used as a light source. These skulls, with their
evil lighted eyes, are making you feel paranoid. The further you
wander along this path, the more you become overcome by anxiety.

Stone Path~
   Chant, the likes of which you have never head before, lingers
in the air, and seems to have no source. The pitch and timbre seem
to drone on without fluctuation. A low baseline seems to support
the higher pitched variations. The chanting is of another
language, almost completely alien to your ears. It is almost
trancing, much like the mystics' sacred chant from your home
world; however, this chant twists the mind. If you pause long
enough to allow yourself to listen, you'll become hypnotized, and
will convert to the wicked ways of the Order.

Stone Path~
   The landscaping here is very peculiar. It has been designed in
such a way, that it creates an almost optical illusion. Everything,
including the shrubbery and walkway, has been heightened. The
constant, slow-changing elevation, almost goes unnoticed. Until
you turn around and gaze back to where you came from, you wouldn't
notice the bizarre alterations of the landscape. It makes you feel
a bit unbalanced and queazy.

Path Corner~
   You stand in the south west corner of the courtyard. To the
south, is the side of a large, black building. Rafters hang out
over the path above, and huge stainglass windows depict mythical
legends. Gazing up, the sharp rafters look like giant teeth,
violently gnashing at the sky. The stainglass seems to be
symbolic, even archetypal: an old man, a young child, and a
beautiful maiden, are lying naked on stone alters. Above them are
dark, swirling vapors. The whole pictorial is permeated with
shadows, which seem to be cast from the fateful, menacing murk.

Stone Path~
   To the east you can see the entryway of the dark building.
Dangling from the rafter is a chain-link tapestry, painted with a
blood-red, hexagonal design. It seems as though the devastation
here, whatever it was, has had traumatic effects on the
inhibitors. This explains this counterculture, this demonic
escapism. The followers of this Order have become psychotic; they
have become trapped in a nihilistic loop, unable to break free
from their perpetual neurasthenia.

Courtyard Walkway~
   Metal beams extend out over the walkway. Each beam holds a 
cow skull which illuminates the path. The walkway, when looked at 
from a distance, appears to be the jaws of a large beast, with its 
teeth arching over the path, as if it's trying to swallow it. In the 
distance you can hear chanting. The chant permeates throughout 
the air, and leaves no sign of origin. If one was subjected to this 
constant, low-pitched murmuring for longer than a day, one would 
be driven mad.

Courtyard Walkway~
   Thin stone plates are scattered about on the path. They have 
been smoothed down by use, and create a nice, flat surface. This 
walkway has been designed so that it stands out from all the rest 
of the courtyard. Its size is double what it should be, which creates 
a pleasant, unobstructed sensation. Steel beams jut out of the 
ground on either side of the walkway. Black, braided leather
hangs from the spires, and fastens a cow skull. The skulls have
been hollowed, and cut open on the top so they can hold candles
in the skull, rather than in the eye-sockets. The skulls look as if 
they are glowing from within, like an oversized fire-fly.

Centeral Sanctuary~
   Massive obsidian stones have been carved and polished in the
shape of sharp pyramids. They are placed evenly around this 
sanctum, forming a large, circular fringe. Placed in the center of 
the sanctuary, is a towering stone sculpture of a man wearing a 
cowl, yet, he has the head of a goat. Placed around the statue are 
black, circular cushions, used for meditation. There are many 
offerings placed around the base of the statue. You assume this 
satanic figure, this dark guru, is the lord of this Order of darkness.
