A Tunnel Within the Burrows~
   For the first time during your journey beneath the surface, you actually
feel a sense of peace and security. If you wish, you can remain here to rest
your weary bones or you could venture back into the network of tunnels to the
south. It may also be possible to work your way through the dirt roof and
back onto the surface.

completed. You could be mistaken, but it looks like you could work your way
through the scant covering of grass above you and onto the surface. The tunnel
to the south will take you back into the burrows.

   As expected, you now stand face to face with a wall of dirt. It appears
as if this area of the tunnel as been set aside as some type of animal shelter,
a number of kennel-like holes dug into the tunnel walls either side of you.
The bones of small forest creatures lie scattered about on the floor and
tufts of fur have been placed down to fashion what looks like a mat.

return east.

from the east and wonder what its source is. The tunnel also extends to the

   You discover the source of the water is in fact numerous tree roots which
crowd the southern exit from the tunnel. It streams down the roots and forms
pools of water on the ground, changing the usually dry dirt into mud. You
could push your way south through the roots or return to the west.

exposed body is now a thin film of mud thanks to the heat you've already
experienced. You may travel to the east or south from here.

now as you find yourself deep within the maze beneath the surface. Looking
down, you see a series of footprints, the majority of which lead to the north.

   A light breeze cools you down slightly and you wonder why you had not
noticed any air flow previously. The only entrance for air into this place
was through the way you came in and it certainly couldn't progress this far
without an exit point. You are uncertain as to which direction the breeze
came from but you can try and find it by crawling to the west or south.

   The first thing you notice is the smell, then you see the cause. Off to
the side of the tunnel is the rotting carcass of what must have been a deer.
You are almost overwhelmed by the stench but notice that the animal could not
have been dead for too long. Large sections of flesh have been torn from its
body and congealed blood has mixed with dirt to form a sticky mass on the
floor. You decide to move on and can travel to the north or south.

   As you make your way northward you become even more suspicious that there
is a reason no one walks this route. You are unsure why because the path to
the east is covered by large tree roots beyond which you cannot see. However,
they look flexible enough so you might be able to squeeze through if you
wanted. Otherwise, you will have to journey back to the south.

   No sooner have you made your way through the wall of roots than you stumble
and fall down a rather deep pit. Cursing silently you realize there is no easy
way out of here and climbing up the dirt wall would surely result in half of
it collapsing down upon you. The bones of others as fortunate as yourself rest
on the ground but you can find nothing that would aid in your escape.

   For some reason this area of the burrows has been frequented regularly 
judging by the number of footprints on the ground. However, what strikes you
as odd is that they only travel north and south along the tunnel, not to the
west. Tree roots to the west make it difficult to pass but you could certainly
squeeze through with some effort.

the north. As you ponder which way to go, the earthen walls begin to shake and
a cloud of dirt fills the air. There is a rumbling noise which grows louder
and louder by the minute before it passes over the top of you and is gone
as suddenly as it came. You have no idea what is was and decide that it might
be more prudent to move on unless the roof itself caves in upon you.

one piece so you can only assume it wasn't eaten by the inhabitants of this
place. Whatever remained of the poor soul's possessions have been taken and
he now rests here in eternal sleep. Stepping over the corpse, you can go to
the west or south.

matter how hard you struggle, you can't pull yourself through. While you sit
and ponder what to do, you hear what sounds like escaping air. You realize that
by sticking yourself in the tunnel, you've created a pressure differential
which thankfully pushes you out. Of course, you strike your head on a tree
root in the process but you are now free to continue to the north or south.

down but whatever constructed these tunnels has obviously done the bare
minimum of work to ensure that won't happen. You have a choice of exits; north
west or east.

   You just miss falling into a small ditch in the middle of the tunnel. It is
perfectly shaped as though a giant ball had been placed there at one time.
Fortunately, you are not hurt and can continue to the west, north or east.

A Tunnel Within the Burrows~
   Clumps of dirt fall from the roof and walls as you walk through the burrows.
Despite the roots that appear to extend in all directions, the tunnels lack
the moisture necessary to hold this area together. You must be careful as you
journey to avoid being buried alive. A small source of light can just be seen
to the east while tunnels continue to the north, west and south.

Entrance to the Burrows~
   Light filters through a maze of tree roots above you and illuminates a
small room carved out of the earth. Tunnels spear off in all directions
although you can't see more than a few feet into them. Unknown sounds
occasionally break the silence around you and a shiver runs down your spine
either in anticipation or fear.

   Dirt, dirt and even more dirt. Not surprising since the tunnel has been
created beneath the surface of the forest but you're already covered in the
stuff and it's not pleasant. You duck just in time to miss one of the many
tree roots that criss-cross the roof and walls and wonder how far this
tunnel system could possibly extend. You can barely make out a small room to
the west while the tunnel extends to the south and east.

   It must have taken years to build this underground network, especially
since it looks like it was done by hand...or perhaps you could say claw. The
scratch marks in the walls are very obvious and although the earthen walls
crumble easily under your touch, it must have taken a lot of work to dig
through and then remove the tons of dirt. Your only options here are to
travel to the west or east.

   You step into the northwestern corner of what appears to be a sleeping 
chamber within the burrows. The only difference between this area and the
tunnels you have traveled through is the size, dirt is still everywhere and
the oppressive heat from lack of air flow is starting to wear you down. Simple
mats of branches and leaves are scattered haphazardly around the cave and you
can easily hear the loud slumber of something but you cannot see into the
darkness. The cave continues to the east and south or you may enter one of
the tunnels to the north or west.

   This corner of the chamber is noticeably smaller than the others and funnels
into a tunnel that leads to the north. You trip on something and land face
first into the dirt floor, narrowly missing one of the branches laid out here.
Looking back, a collection of six animal bones has been painstakingly buried
into the ground in the shape of a circle for reasons unknown. Ponder as you
might, you cannot find a reason and decide to continue.

   No sooner have you made your way through the wall of roots than you stumble
and fall down a rather deep pit. Cursing silently you realize there is no easy
way out of here and climbing up the dirt wall would surely result in half of it
collapsing down upon you. The bones of others as fortunate as yourself rest on
the ground but you can find nothing that would aid in your escape.

and a cloud of dirt fills the air. There is a rumbling noise which grows louder
and louder by the minute before it passes over the to of you and is gone as
suddenly as it came. You have no idea what it was and decide that it might
be more prudent to move on unless the roof itself caves in upon you.

distinct lack of flesh and the layer of dirt covering it but why it is here
remains a mystery. The tunnel extends to the north and south.

have been the beginning of another tunnel but it never progressed more than a
few feet. The entrance to the burrows lies just to the north while the tunnel
continues to the east and south.

   You find yourself in the southwestern corner of a small cave which is in
fact merely an extension of the tunnel system you have made your way through.
It's simply connected to three other rooms and has had the centre area removed
to increase its size. Judging by the collection of branches and leaves, you
believe the area is used as a sleeping chamber by the tunnel occupants which is
somewhat disconcerting since it means they are probably still here. The cave
continues to the north and east while a single tunnel departs to the west.

You can imagine this place during the heat of the day as being similar to
walking through a wall of fire and are thankful at least that the darkness
keeps the temperature down a little.

have been dead for too long. Large sections of flesh have been torn from its
body and congealed blood has mixed with dirt to form a sticky mess on the
floor. You decide to move on and can travel to the north or south.

are damaged beyond repair but something may be of value if you scrounge
around a bit.

The Center of the Burrows~
   You have stumbled across the heart of the orc burrows for it is here that
the numerous raids these creatures carry out are planned. The rotting corpses
of many unfortunate creatures litter the floor and the stench of death is
very overpowering. Screams of agony echo around you and you realize not all
within this chamber is dead. Eyes glow in the surrounding darkness and all
seem to be focused on you.

The Center of the Burrows~
   You skirt around a makeshift table in the centre of the room and have the
choice of moving to the west or south. You trip over a collection of bones
in the corner and land head first into the carcass of a small forest animal.
The signs of decay are abundant as you look around after having wiped yourself
off and you pity the victims of the Dharzi orcs who will eventually wind up
here.

The Center of the Burrows~
   You step on the arm of what looks like a dwarven warrior and he yelps in
pain and surprise. He has a number of tear marks and his flesh almost hangs
from his body. The Dharzi orcs have claimed another victim who will shortly
join his companions in the spiritual plane. You may leave him and travel to
the north or east.

The Center of the Burrows~
   Blood pooling on the floor is now rising at an alarming level given the
size of this chamber. You are now up to your ankles in the stuff which doesn't
seem to be disappearing quickly. Body parts from numerous creatures have been
hung from the chamber roof in the twisted maze of roots that cover it. You
decide it might be more prudent to continue moving to the north or west.

An Orc Storeroom~
   The two rooms here, the other to the north, are obviously used to store
the bounty the orcs obtain when they go on their village raids. You can see
a variety of weapons and armor pieces, chests of treasure and a number of
useless trinkets which must have caught their eye. Most of the items here
are damaged beyond repair but something may be of value if you scrounge
around a bit.

A Tunnel Within the Burrows~
   You stand outside some type of store room, only apparent by the large amount
of goods you can see through the molded doorway in the western wall. You may
enter if you wish or journey back down the tunnel to the south.

At the Base of a Large Hole~
   There is no real difference between the tunnel you now find yourself in and
those you have passed through to get here. At least the proximity to the river
has provided some moisture to the earthen walls and they now look slightly more
robust that others within the burrow. The tunnel leads on to the north or you
can return to the upper level through the hole in the roof.
