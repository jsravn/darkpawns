Dark Pawns
==========

Dark Pawns was a [MUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) that operated from approximately 1997 to 2010.

You can see the original opening announcement on rec.games.mud.announce [here](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rec.games.mud.announce/B-LpxjOtc_c/discussion).

The code and world are now available on [Github](https://github.com/rparet/darkpawns) at the request of some nostalgic former players.

Everything here is represents the state of the game, warts and all, at the time of its shutdown in 2010. 

DP has not actively been maintained and it's likely that significant effort might be required to return the game to a useable state.

Thanks

It was really my pleasure to be an Implementor for 13 years and collaborate and interact with so many fantastic people. I hope you enjoy peeking behind the curtain
as much as I enjoyed running the game! - Frontline
